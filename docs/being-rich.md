# What "Being Rich" Actually Looks Like

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

## The Most Valuable Thing Money Can Buy is Time.

The most important thing money can buy is your time. The whole game is about putting yourself in a financial position where you can walk away from your job, *consequence free.* 

However, this freedom only comes from **cash flow**, and significant reserves to fall back on when life gets hard. 

Ask yourself the following question:

:::info Which of these would be more useful to you?

- A million dollars in a 401K you can't touch *at all* for the next 40 years?
- Or $10,000 deposited into your checking account each month whether you get out of bed in the morning or not?

:::

**I like option 2.**

### - "Passive Income" vs "Active Income"

Cash flow comes form 2 different sources. 

There is cash flow you obtain from trading your time, energy and cognitive resources (known as Active Income).

There is also cash flow that you obtain as a reward for buying or building assets that provide cash flow (Passive Income).

>In other words, if your lifestyle costs you $2500/month, but you have $5000/month in cash flow because you have built/bought/acquired assets that provide passive income, you never have to work again **unless you choose to.** 

### - "F-You Money"

The threshold at which you attain this freedom has many names:

- Financial Independence, 
- Financial Freedom, 
- Early Retirement,

:::note But this one is my personal favorite:

F-You money.
>You can use your imagination to figure out what the F stands for.

:::

### - Become bolder with your choices

People talk about personal finance like it's a **math problem**, but personal finance is a **psychology problem**. 

The game is all about having enough money to put yourself into a position where you never have to submit to your employer or your paycheck. 

>Time is the only resource you can never buy more of! Stop selling it for pennies on the dollar for a job you hate, at a company you don't respect!

Living for the weekend is not much of a life at all. It is also entirely *optional.*

### - An army of spreadsheet nerds researching this

There exists a community of personal finance nerds (including me) who dedicate our time to uncover every single strategy, tactic, and unfair advantage related to personal finance, and all of this material is made freely avaibale online. 

We are known as, the FI community.

:::note Pronunciation

"FI" pronounced like "eye".

:::

Our goal is to get individuals' [Savings Rates](/kpis/savings-rate.md) as high as we can, then invest that money as aggresively as possible into assets that produce the most passive income, so that you don't have to trade time for money *any longer than is absolutely necessary.*
