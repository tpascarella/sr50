# Benefits

As soon as you have a "big boy/girl" job, it will likely come with a benefits package that you should take full advantage of.

## Understand Your Benefits

I can't give an exact recommendation because I don't know what company you work for or what they offer, that information will be found on your company's HR website.

:::tip Read it!

Know all of the options available to you! It's free money you can take advantage of if you know the opportunities available.

## Retirement Accounts

### - Take the match

If your company offers a $1 for $1 match for contributions up to a certain percent, then that is a 100% return on your money. That is a great bet and you should invest up to the match (if you can afford the slight reduction in paycheck)

### - Check the expense ratios

Many of the investment options are mutual or index funds, which can vary widely in expense ratios.

If it is less than 10 basis points, you will be just fine.

:::note 

Basis points refer to hundredths of a percent. For example, 5 basis points would equal a .05% expense ratio.
