# Career Overview

In this section we will go over different tactics to build a great career, and to make sure that it pays you enough to become financially independent in a short time time.

Topics include:

## [Career Considerations](considerations.md)

Once you have a few offer sheets in hand, how do you compare them to one another? How do you know you are making a good decision?

## [Futureproofing](futureproofing.md)

You need to consider the long term viability of your career. Automation will replace the cognitive output of 110-140 million full time knowledge workers by 2025, so you need to plan for this now.

You need to be able to rapidly acquire skills that people will pay you for.

## [Job Search](job-search.md)

Job hunting is stressful. You will likely need to send out hundreds of applications, for a 2% interview rate, and a 10-15% hit rate for offers. 

Keeping morale high is of critical importance.

## [Formal Education](formal-education.md)

If you need to gain more education to advance your career, you better make sure that the *massive* investment is justified.

## [Benefits](benefits.md)

Your benefits make up around 30% of your total compensation, so make the most out of what's available! Educate yourself on what your company offers and how you can maximally take advantage.

## [Military Careers](military.md)

Due to all of the benefits and opportunities available to people in the military, military careers are a surprisingly **fantastic** path to become financially independent in a short period of time. 

Many of the benefits are still available to you after your service ends.
