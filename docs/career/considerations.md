# Career Considerations

There are a few things to keep in the back of your head when deciding to take a new job.

- Do the people elevate your ambition level?
- Do you use the company's product? Or deeply respect them?
- Do you want to make this company a lot of money?
- Are you willing to live where the job requires?
- Is the pay enough for you to progress towards FI?
- Are you learning things of value?
- Does the company have a promising future?
- Are you able to develop your deep work ability?
- Are the stress levels within your tolerance?

A job you are considering doesn't need to have all of these qualities, but the more the better. At the very least you need to have an answer to these questions. The more Runway you have, the longer you can hold out for finding a job you really like at a company you really respect.

## Make an Informed Decision

Make a list of all the potential things you want to know about a new job, personal and professional. Then try to find an answer to 70% of the questions on that list.

:::note How to Know You Made a Good Decision

If you have 70% of the knowable information, and have made estimates for best case-worst case scenario. You can be reasonably certain that you made a good decision.

Even if the job doesn't work out, you can justify to yourself that your thought process going into it was solid, and will help you make even better decisions in the future.
