# Career Considerations

There are a few things to keep in the back of your head when deciding to take a new job.

- Do The People Elevate Your Ambition Level?
- Do You Use the Company's Product? Or At Least Respect The Company You Work For?
- Do You Want to Make the Company a Lot of Money?
- Are You Willing to Live Where The Job Is?
- Is the Pay Enough to Meet All of Your Needs?
- Are You Learning Things of Value?

A job you are considering doesn't need to have all of these qualities, but the more the better. At minimum you should have an answer to all of these questions. 

The more Runway you have, the longer you can hold out for finding a job you really like at a company you really respect.
