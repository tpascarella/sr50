# Formal Education

Formal education is becoming less and less valuable as time goes on.

If you are going to pay a significant amount for an advanced degree, you better do your homework and make sure you can make enough money with that degree to justify your efforts.

[Here](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors) is a good site showing how much you can make with a bachelors degree. 

Remember Cal Newport's advice from the career section. Passion in your career grows over time as you gain skill, and autonomy over your work. You are much better off picking something you are mildly interested in but want to be really good at, than following your preexisting passion right away.

If you have the ability to have your place of work pay for free college courses, feast on that buffet!
