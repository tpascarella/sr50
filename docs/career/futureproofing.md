# Futureproofing

This is an area you need to be particularly careful with. Being 25 myself, I will need to deal with automation for the entirety of my working career.

You need to develop a skillset that will make you relevant moving forward, but will also make you useful to companies moving forward. If automation wipes out your employer, you're out of a job as well.

Check out [Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/) from Y Combinator. These are the companies that will provide all of the jobs moving forward, so be useful to companies who will be useful going forward.
