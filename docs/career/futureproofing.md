# Futureproofing

This is an area you need to be particularly careful with. Being 25 myself, I will need to deal with automation for the entirety of my working career.

You need to develop a skillset that will make you relevant moving forward, but will also make you useful to companies moving forward. If automation wipes out your employer, you're out of a job as well.

Check out [Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/) from Y Combinator. These are the companies that will provide all of the jobs moving forward, so be useful to companies who will be useful going forward.

## No Regressions, No Regressions, No Regressions

Every job you take should be incrementally additive to your human capital. You don't need to get the first job right, just the last job. 

Each position should be an upgrade in skills, requirements, pay, and work-life balance that you are willing to take on.
