## Leverage in Negotiations

You want to get at least 3 offers in hand before making a final decision. Even better is that once you have an offer in hand, you can use that as leverage to make the company you are interviewing with move faster. 

You want companies to compete against each other for your services.

## What Job is Best for You?

At jobs, you should either earn a shit ton of money, or learn new skills constantly. Even better if you can get both. 

However most jobs will not provide both, so make sure that it provides at least one. If your job provides neither, find a new job as fast as possible!

## Accepting an Offer

:::tip

If you feel like you have at least 70% of knowable information, and have considered the proper cost/benefit for each position, you can be reasonably sure you chose the right job, even if it ends up not working out.
