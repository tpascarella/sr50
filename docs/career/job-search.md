## Sending Out Applications

You will probably need to send out a hundred applications for every 3 interviews you get.

### - Dealing with rejection

Pretty soon, your email inbox will be just a wall of: 
- "Thank you for your consideration, unfortunately..."
- "We regret to inform you that..."
- "We deeply appreciate your interest in applying, however..."

It's just deflating.

:::tip For when things get dark

These companies have no insight in your value as an employee, and they will probably fire whoever they end up hiring anyway.

Try not to take it personally, they are not nearly as smart as they think.

:::

## Interviewing

Do an hour of research on the company going in, review common interview questions and have a Google Doc with good answers nearby.

Give yourself as many unfair advantages as possible in the interview process.

## Leverage in Negotiations

You want to get at least 3 offers in hand before making a final decision. 

You want companies to compete against each other for your services.

:::note

Once you have an offer in hand, you can use that as leverage to make the company you are interviewing with move faster or offer you more money. 

:::

## When to Accept an Offer

You can never have all the information you want when making a decision.

If you feel like you have at least 70% of knowable information, and have considered the best/worst case scenario for each position, you can be reasonably sure you chose the right job, even if it ends up not working out.
