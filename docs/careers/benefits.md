>Take full advantage of these.

As soon as you have a "big boy/big girl" job, it will likely come with a benefits package that you should take full advantage of.

## Understand Your Benefits

I can't give an exact recommendation because I don't know what company you work for or what they offer, that information will be found on your company's HR website.

:::tip Read them!

Know all of the options available to you, and plan in advance how you will use it.

## Retirement Accounts

### - Take the match

If your company offers a $1 for $1 match for contributions up to a certain percent, then that is a 100% return on your money. That is a great bet and you should invest up to the match if you can afford the slight reduction in your paycheck.

### - Check expense ratios

Many of the investment fund options avialable to you are mutual funds or index funds, which can vary widely in expense ratios. Put your money into a fund that has less than 10 basis points.

:::info

Basis points refer to hundredths of a percent. For example, 5 basis points would equal a .05% expense ratio.
