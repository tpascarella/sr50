# Careers Overview

In this section we will go over different tactics to build a great career, that pays you enough to become financially independent in a reasonable time.

## [Become So Good They Can't Ignore You](skills.md)

Cal Newport has a great book detailing how to build a career you love. Work satisfaction is an incredibly well researched field, and the TLDR is that you need to develop a rare and valuable skillset, and that gives you the leverage to command rare and valuable work traits in return. 

## [Futureproofing](futureproofing.md)

You need to think about the long term viability of your career. Automation will replace the cognitive output of 110-140 million full time knowledge workers by 2025, so you need to plan for this now.

Pretty soon, the only jobs worth having will be in the tech field, so it would be a good idea to make yourself useful to them as soon as possible.

## [Military Careers](military.md)

Due to all of the benefits and opportunities available to people in the military, military careers are a surprisingly *fantastic* path to become financially independent in a short period of time. 

Many of the benefits are still available to you after your service ends.
