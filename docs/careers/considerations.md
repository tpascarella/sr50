# Career Considerations

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

>Ask yourself these questions:

- Do the people you work with elevate you or deflate you?
- Do you use the company's product? Or at least respect what they do?
- Do you *even want* to make this company a lot of money?
- Is the job worth your time?
- Are you willing to live where the job requires you to?
- Is the pay enough for you to progress towards FI in an acceptable time frame?
- Are you learning skills that will make you relevant in the future?
- Are you able to develop your Deep Work ability?
- Does the company have a promising financial future?
- Are the stress levels for the job within your stress tolerance?
- What does your gut tell you?
- How hard do you want to work?
  >If the answer is very hard, is your career the highest and best use of your time?

A job doesn't need to have all of these qualities, but the more the better, at the very least you need to have an answer to these questions.

The more Runway you have, the longer you can hold out for finding a job you really want, at a company you deeply respect.

## Is The Money Worth The Time?

This is the single most important consideration for your career. People think their salary is just a number on paper, but it’s actually the product of: 

“hours spent” multiplied by “work you do in that time” 

If your job sucks and you hate your life everyday, that is a very expensive job. Don’t ask “is the job is worth the money”, ask “is the job worth the time?” Time is the only thing you can never buy more of, don’t sell it at pennies on the dollar for something as *common as money.*
