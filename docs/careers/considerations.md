# Career Considerations

>Ask yourself these questions:

- Do the people you work with elevate your ambition level?
- Do you use the company's product? Or at least respect what they do?
- Do you even *want* to make this company a lot of money?
- Is the job worth the time? (Forget the money)
- Are you willing to live where the job requires you to?
- Is the pay enough for you to progress towards FI in an acceptable time frame?
- Are you learning skills that will make you relevant in the future?
- Are you able to develop your Deep Work ability?
- Does the company have a promising financial future?
- Are the stress levels for the job within your tolerance?

A job doesn't need to have all of these qualities, but the more the better, at the very least you need to have an answer to these questions.

The more Runway you have, the longer you can hold out for finding a job you really want, at a company you deeply respect.
