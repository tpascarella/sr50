# Career Considerations

>Ask yourself these questions:

- Do the people you work with elevate your ambition?
- Do you use the company's product? Or at least respect what they do?
- Do you even *want* to make this company a lot of money?
- Are you willing to live where the job requires?
- Is the pay enough for you to progress towards FI?
- Are you learning valuable skills?
- Does the company have a promising future?
- Are you able to develop your Deep Work ability?
- Are the stress levels for the job within your tolerance?

At the very least you need to have an answer to these questions. The more Runway you have, the longer you can hold out for finding a job you really want at a company you deeply respect.

A job doesn't need to have all of these qualities, but the more the better.
