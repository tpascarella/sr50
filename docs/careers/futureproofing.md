# Futureproofing

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

>You should be scared of automation.

You need to actively develop a skillset that will make you relevant and employable moving forward. Automation isn't just a concern for you, but your employer as well! If automation wipes out the company you work for, you're on the street as well.

:::tip 

Check out listings at [Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/) from Y Combinator. 

Startups are the companies that will provide all of the jobs moving forward, so it's a good idea to build skills that will make you useful to them.

## Every Job Should Be Incrementally Additive

Every job should be incrementally additive to your [Human Capital](/investing/gen-z-investments/human-capital.md). You don't need to get the first job right, just the last job. Every position should be an upgrade to your skillset, paycheck, and work-life balance.

## How to Become Irreplaceable

### - Don't follow your passion, develop skills

The following talk is based on Cal Newport's book [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124). It's an excellent explanation why building world class skill beats following your passion for developing a career you love.

### - Deep Work

Deep Work means you are able to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. These types of activities enhance your skill, greatly increase the quality and quantity of your production, and are very hard to replicate. It is the most valuable professional skill of the 21st century. In our hyper connected world, if you can build something great it can spread to billions of people, but our attention spans (and ability to do Deep Work) are getting shorter and shorter. 

:::caution Supply and demand

Deep Work is becoming increasingly valuable at the same time it's becoming increasingly rare. This is a classic supply and demand problem, the few who cultivate their Deep Work ability will thrive in our economy moving forward. The ones who don't will get left behind.

The book [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013UWFM52/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) is essential reading for anyone who wants to build up career capital, and [this article](https://blog.doist.com/deep-work/) provides a nice summary.
