>Prepare for a 99% rejection rate.

## Sending Out Applications En Masse

Sending out applications en masse is simply a numbers game. You will probably need to send out a hundred applications to receive maybe 2 interviews. Of those 2 you have a 1 in 10 chance of receiving an offer. 

### - Dealing with rejection

Pretty soon, your email inbox will be a wall of: 
- "Thank you for your consideration, unfortunately..."
- "We regret to inform you that..."
- "We deeply appreciate your interest in applying, however..."

It's just deflating.

:::tip For when things get dark

These companies have no insight in your value as an employee, and they will probably fire whoever they end up hiring anyway. Try not to take it personally, these companies are not nearly as smart as they think.

### - The best way to have your application considered

The best way to have your application considered is to have a personal recommendation from someone with the power to make decisions. If you are submitting a resume into a pile of other resumes, you have already lost.

If you are applying to a startup, message the founder on LinkedIn! Relationship networking pays off far more than typical LinkedIn networking.

## Interviewing

Give yourself as many unfair advantages as possible in the interview process, for example:

- Dress slightly better than the people interviewing you
- Research the company you are applying for (what they do, their GlassDoor ratings, etc)
- Prepare for common interview questions. Keep a Google Doc of answers on another tab
- Have a list of 5 questions you have for them. Ask about the people and the technical skills they want from employees.
- Show up on time. (duh)
- Remember this is an interview for THEM as much as it is for you. You are selling your time and energy (Your most valuable resource and another really valuable one) in exchange for something as common as money, keep that in proportion.

### Take as many interviews as you can

Take as many interviews as you can get, even if you have no intention of joining the company. It will give you exposure to the types of questions they ask, the types of questions *you should ask*, and the general vibe of the office.

If you feel a buzz at the office, that's a good sign that company is a vibrant and exciting place to work. If it looks straight out of Office Space, be wary.

### Research the company

Look at the Glassdoor and Indeed ratings for every company you interview with. See how they treat current and churned employees. It's safe to assume how they treat past employees is how they will treat you.

## Negotiating an Offer

### - Leverage

You want companies to compete against each other for your services. It's good to wait until you have at least 3 offers in hand before making a final decision.

Once you have an offer in hand, you can use that as leverage to make the company you are interviewing with move faster or offer you more money. 

## Accepting an Offer

You can never have all the information you want when making a decision, but if you believe you have at least 70% of knowable information, and have considered the best/worst case scenario, you can be reasonably sure you chose the right job, even if it ends up not working out.

A good book for making this decision is [How to Decide](https://www.amazon.com/How-Decide-Simple-Making-Choices-ebook/dp/B07TRJB3S3) by Annie Duke.
