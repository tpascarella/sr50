>Prepare for a 99% rejection rate.

## Sending Out Applications

### - En Masse

You will probably need to send out a hundred applications to receive maybe 2 interviews. Sending out applications en masse is a numbers game.

### - Dealing with rejection

Pretty soon, your email inbox will be a wall of: 
- "Thank you for your consideration, unfortunately..."
- "We regret to inform you that..."
- "We deeply appreciate your interest in applying, however..."

It's just deflating.

:::tip For when things get dark

These companies have no insight in your value as an employee, and they will probably fire whoever they end up hiring anyway. Try not to take it personally, these companies are not nearly as smart as they think.

:::

### - The best way to have your application considered

The best way to have your application considered is to have a personal recommendation from someone with the power to make decisions. If you are applying to a startup, message the founder on LinkedIn!

If you are submitting a resume into a pile, you have already lost.

## Interviewing

Give yourself as many unfair advantages as possible in the interview process, for example:

- Dress slightly better than the people interviewing you
- Research the company you are applying for (what they do, GlassDoor ratings, etc)
- Prepare for common interview questions, keep a Google Doc of answers on another tab

## Negotiating an Offer

### - Leverage

You want companies to compete against each other for your services. It's good to wait until you have at least 3 offers in hand before making a final decision.

:::note

Once you have an offer in hand, you can use that as leverage to make the company you are interviewing with move faster or offer you more money. 

:::

## Accepting an Offer

You can never have all the information you want when making a decision, but if you believe you have at least 70% of knowable information, and have considered the best/worst case scenario, you can be reasonably sure you chose the right job, even if it ends up not working out.

A good book for making this decision is [How to Decide](https://www.amazon.com/How-Decide-Simple-Making-Choices-ebook/dp/B07TRJB3S3) by Annie Duke.
