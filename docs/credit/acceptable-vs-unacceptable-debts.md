# "Acceptable" & "Unacceptable" Debts

## Acceptable Debts

"Acceptable" debts are debts at low interest rates which you can tactfully use to increase your Savings Rate. 

Examples of acceptable debts include mortgages on rental properties, Student Loans to get a degree that will actually increase your income, and prime car loans in order to get to work and make money.

:::caution 

While these debts are not the worst thing in the world to have, they should never be accrued needlessly. 

:::

As long as they increase your Savings Rate, these can be kept. (within reason)

## Unnaceptable Debts

"Unacceptable" debts include high interest debt from things like credit cards, subprime car loans, payday loans, or any personal loans to friends or family. 

:::danger

These debts do you absolutely no good. Get rid of them as fast as you can.

### - Takeaway

Not all debts need to be eliminated from your financial position immediately, as a lot of financial professionals would have you believe. 

Unacceptable debts should be cleared as fast as possible.
