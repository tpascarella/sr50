# Credit Cards

## Your First Credit Cards

In order to build your credit history, you will first need to register for a few secured cards. You will need to spend around $250 in security deposits for these cards (it's riskier lending to people who have zero history), but those deposits will be returned to you in a couple of months of responsible spending.

## Optimizing for Rewards

Different cards will have different rewards. Use the highest grocery store rewards card to buy your groceries, and the highest gas station rewards card to buy gas.

Target one reward at a time, and understand how much needs to be spent by when. It's best if you can use these limits to make a scheduled resupply, explained in the [Minimalism](/lifestyle/minimalism.md) section.

## The Horror Stories You Hear

All of the horror stories you hear online about people getting burned with credit cards all come from irresponsible spending, and overleveraging yourself with payments for houses and cars.

If you treat buying things with credit cards like buying things with cash, you will be just fine.
