# Credit Cards

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

>Use these like you use cash and you'll be fine.

## Highest and Best Use Cases

Different cards will have different rewards programs. Use the highest grocery store rewards card to buy your groceries, the highest gas station rewards card to buy gas, and so on. Use a label maker to write the optimum use case for each of your credit cards. Also make sure to note the billing zip codes for each card. 

### - Points and miles

Each new card you apply for will likely come with a reward of points or miles after spending a certain amount in a predetermined time frame. This can be used to travel for free, explained in the [Travel Hacking section.](travel-hacking.md)

Target one reward at a time, and know how much needs to be spent and by when. Helpful to add it to your Google Calendar. Use these cards for your scheduled resuppliyes, explained in the [Minimalism](/lifestyle/minimalism.md) section.

## Organizing Your Cards

If you collected baseball cards as a kid, the plastic pages you would put the cards in are a great organizational tool for your credit cards.

It is best to keep these in a binder with a zippered closure [like this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007SQZE5U/?coliid=I2LHB0U9SZM8ZI&colid=JBE09B17WEP6&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it), credit cards have a tendency to slide out of the sleeves relatively easily and you definitely don't want these scattering everywhere.

## Horror Stories With Credit Cards

All of the horror stories you hear online about people getting burned with credit cards **all come from irresponsible spending.** 

If you treat buying things with credit cards the same way you buy things with cash, you will be just fine.
