# Credit Cards

## Your First Credit Cards

In order to build your credit history, you will first need to register for a few secured cards. You will need to spend around $250 in security deposits for these cards (it's riskier lending to people who have zero history), but those deposits will be returned to you in a couple of months of responsible spending.

## Optimizing for Rewards

Different cards will have different rewards. Use the highest grocery store rewards card to buy your groceries, and the highest gas station rewards card to buy gas.

## Organizing Your Credit Cards

If you collected baseball cards as a kid, the plastic pages you would put the cards in are a great organizational tool for your credit cards.
