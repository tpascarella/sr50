## How Your Credit Score is Calculated

- On-time payments (High impact)
- Credit utilization (High impact)
- Age of credit (Medium impact)
- Total accounts (Low impact)
- Credit inquiries (Low impact)
- Derogatory marks (High impact)

## Building Credit From Scratch

You will need to get a couple of secured cards, you can find the best versions at [NerdWallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/secured-credit-cards)

It will probably cost you ~$250 in security deposits for these cards, but the $250 will be returned within a few months of responsible spending.
