## The Factors that Determine Credit Score

Credit bureaus use 6 criteria when determining your credit score:

### - High impact
- On-time payments (**should always be 100%!**)
- Credit utilization (**use less than 30% of your available credit at any given time**)
- Derogatory marks (**don't have any**)

### - Medium impact
- Age of credit (**longer the better**)

### - Low impact
- Total accounts (**more is better**)
- Credit inquiries (**don't apply for new credit cards too often**)
