## Importance

**There is absolutely no reason why you can't have an excellent credit score.**

Having great credit makes life much easier, from getting an apartment or a car, to even finding a job 
(they can run a check on you) *everything becomes easier when you have good credit.*

Your credit score will range between 300 - 850. Credit bureaus use 6 criteria when determining your score:

## Monitoring Your Credit Score

[Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) is my personal credit score monitoring platform, but [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/) is also a good choice.

### - High impact
- On-time payments (**should always be 100%!**)
- Credit utilization (**always use less than 30% of available credit at any one time**)
- Derogatory marks (**don't have any**)

### - Medium impact
- Age of credit (**the longer the better**)

### - Low impact
- Total accounts (**more is better, include both revolving and installment**)
- Credit inquiries (**don't apply for new credit cards too often**)

## Your First Credit Cards

If you are building your credit score from scratch ypu will need to get a few secured credit cards, you can find the best options at [NerdWallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/secured-credit-cards)

It will cost you ~$250 in security deposits for these cards, but the $250 will be returned within a few months of on time payments.

## Maintaining Great Credit

To maintain a high credit score, follow a few basic principles:

- Pay off your credit cards every month.
- Keep your utilization under 30%.
- Only open a new credit card around every 6 months.
- Don't close old credit cards (using them for any purpose will prevent them from being closed).

You will need to monitor your credit until the day you die. 

Make it a habit.
