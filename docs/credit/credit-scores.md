# Credit Scores

## Range of Credit Scores

Your credit score can range between 300-850, and there is *absolutely no reason* why you can't have an **excellent** credit score.

## The Factors that Determine Credit Score

Credit bureaus use 6 criteria when determining your credit score:

### High impact
- On-time payments (**should always be 100%!**)
- Credit utilization (**use less than 30% of your available credit at any given time**)
- Derogatory marks (**don't have any**)

### Medium impact
- Age of credit (**longer the better**)

### Low impact
- Total accounts (**more is better**)
- Credit inquiries (**don't apply for new credit cards too often**)

## The Horror Stories You Hear

All of the horror stories you hear online and people getting burned with credit cards all come from irresponsible spending, and overleveraging yourself with payments for houses and cars.

Treat credit cards like you treat cash, and don't take on too big a payment for houses and cars and you will **be just fine**.
