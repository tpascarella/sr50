# Debt Paydown Strategies

>The Snowball and the Avalanche.

There are 2 primary methods that people use to paydown their debt. The [Debt Snowball](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/debt/how-the-debt-snowball-method-works), and the [Debt Avalanche.](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/what-is-a-debt-avalanche)

## Debt Snowball

The Debt Snowball was coined by Dave Ramsey, and is the best strategy to eliminate your debts because of the psychological boost of getting small wins paying them off.

## Debt Avalanche

The Debt Avalanche is different in that you pay off debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest rate.

It is claimed that this results in lower total payments (although this is disputed), but it doesn't come with the psychological benefit of quick wins that the Snowball does, and that is why I prefer the Snowball method.

### - Takeaway

While the Avalanche method *might* result in fewer dollars spent paying down your debt balance, the quick victories of the Snowball method make it the superior debt paydown strategy in my opinion.

And in all honestly, if you are the type of person who wakes up one day and realizes you're drowning in debt, you probably were never too concerned with math to begin with.
