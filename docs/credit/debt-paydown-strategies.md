# Debt Paydown Strategies

>The snowball and the avalanche.

There are 2 primary methods that people use to paydown their debt. The debt snowball, and the debt avalanche.

## Debt Snowball

The Debt Snowball was coined by Dave Ramsey, and is the best way to eliminate your debts because of the psychological boost of getting small wins paying them off.

[Here is an article from Ramsey](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/debt/how-the-debt-snowball-method-works) explaining the process in detail.

## Debt Avalanche

The Debt Avalanche is different in that you pay off debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest rate.

It is claimed that this results in lower total payments (although this is disputed), but doesn't come with the psychological benefit of quick wins that the Snowball does, and why I prefer the Snowball method to the Avalanche method.

### - Takeaway

While the Avalanche method *might* result in fewer dollars spent paying down your debt balance, the quick victories of the Snowball method make it the superior debt paydown strategy in my opinion.

Plus, in all honestly if you are the kind of person who wakes up one day and realizes you're drowning in debt, you probably aren't too concerned with math to begin with.
