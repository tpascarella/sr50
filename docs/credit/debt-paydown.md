# Debt Paydown Strategies

There are 2 primary methods that people use to paydown their debt. The debt snowball, and the debt avalanche.

### Takeaway

:::tip 

While the Avalanche method might result in fewer dollars spent paying down your debt balance, the quick victories of the snowball method make it the superior debt paydown method in my opinion.

Plus, honestly if you are the kind of person who wakes up one day and realizes you are drowning in debt, you probably aren't too concerned with math to begin with.
