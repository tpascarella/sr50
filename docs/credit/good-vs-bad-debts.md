# "Good Debts" vs "Bad Debts"

## "Good Debts"

"Good" debts are debts at low interest rates which you can tactfully use to increase your Savings Rate. Examples of good debts include mortgages on rental properties, Student Loans to get a degree that will actually increase your income, and prime car loans in order to get to work and make money. These are not the worst things in the world to have, and can be left alone for now. These debts should never be accrued excessively or needlessly, however. 

## "Bad Debts"

"Bad" debts include high interest debt from things like credit cards, subprime car loans, payday loans, or any personal loans to friends or family. These debts do you absolutely no good, so get rid of them as fast as you can.
