# Student Loans

Housing, Transportation and Food are the 3 categories that should get the most mathematical attention from you, but Student Loans will probably get the most emotional attention from you. 

## Savings Rate Takes Priority

You're probably wondering if your mammoth Student Loan balance means that you’re screwed. Once again you’ll be happy to hear, no! You're not! 

Why? 

Because we are looking at your Student Loans through the lens of how it impacts your Savings Rate and Runway. (are you noticing the pattern?) 

Let's say you have $90K in student loans, and the payment comes out to $900 a month. Is that ideal? No. But is it manageable? Yes. $900 a month is one house hack. You are one house hack away from your Student Loans never being a stressor again. 

This is just one more example of why Net Worth pales in significance to Savings Rate and Runway. If you have a shitty Net Worth due to your Student Loans, but a strong Savings Rate and healthy amount of Runway in spite of that, you’re doing great no matter what your Net Worth is, or how intimidating your Student Loan balance may seem.

## Recommendations

Services like [SoFi](https://www.sofi.com/refinance-student-loan/) can refinance your loan down to the minimum monthly payment, which in turn will have the smallest impact on your Savings Rate.

## "But What If I Need to go Back to School?"

First thing, you better make sure you're majoring in something that can make you some money. Use common sense here, a computer science degree will pay far more than a theater degree. Do an hour of research beforehand on the highest paying majors, and pick one you are reasonably interested in. If you don't have a passion for it yet, that's ok. We'll cover that in the work chapter. Lastly, state schools offer pretty much as good a quality education as the Ivy Leagues, at significantly lower cost, so the fancy name isn't worth the extra expense.
