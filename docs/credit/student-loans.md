# Student Loans

>Solvable!

Housing, Transportation and Food are the 3 categories that should get the most **mathematical attention** from you, but Student Loans will probably get the most **emotional attention** from you. 

## Savings Rate Makes Up For Everything

You're probably wondering if your mammoth Student Loan balance means that you’re screwed. You'll be happy to hear that no! You're not!

Why? Because we are looking at your Student Loans through the lens of how it impacts your Savings Rate and Runway. (are you beginning to notice the pattern?) 

:::info Student Loan Math

Let's say you have $90K in student loans, and the payment comes out to $900 a month. 

Is that ideal? No. But is that manageable? Yes. 

$900 a month is one house hack. You are **one house hack away** from your Student Loan payment never being a stressor again. 

:::

This is just one more example of why Net Worth pales in comparison to Savings Rate and Runway. If you have a shitty Net Worth due to your Student Loans, but a strong Savings Rate and healthy amount of Runway in spite of that, you’re doing great no matter what your Net Worth is, or how intimidating your Student Loan balance may seem.

A strong Savings Rate will absolutely make up for a poor Net Worth.

## Recommendations

There are online services that can refinance your loan down to the minimum monthly payment, which in turn will have the smallest impact on your Savings Rate.

## "But What If I Need to go Back to School?"

If you need to go back to school, first thing is you **better make sure** you're majoring in something that can make you some money. 

Do an hour of research Googling the highest paying majors, and pick one you are reasonably interested in. 

If you don't have a passion for it yet, that's ok. We'll cover that in the career section. 

### - Public vs. private universities

State schools offer pretty much as good a quality education as the Ivy Leagues, at significantly lower cost, so the fancy name isn't worth the extra expense. 

### - Trade schools

You can make a lot of money as a tradesman, and a lot of these jobs are going unfilled because there aren't enough qualified people to do them.

They might not be as "prestigious" as a typical bachelors degree, however you are guaranteed a job after graduation and are armed with a marketable skill.
