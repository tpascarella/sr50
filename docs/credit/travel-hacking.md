# Travel Hacking

Travel Hacking is the process of intentionally stockpiling credit card points and rewards to travel for free, or exceptionally low cost.

You should never use credit irresponsibly to collect the points, but tactfully using this on the spending **YOU WERE ALREADY GOING TO DO ANYWAY,** is a powerful way to maximize the efficiency of your dollars.

This strategy is a REWARD for responsible money management. Never spend irresponsibly just to stockpile rewards!

Credit card companies make money hand over fist because of the impulsive nature of the general public.
