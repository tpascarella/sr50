# Apps

## Credit Karma

Credit Karma is my favorite app to keep track of my credit score, it has officially surpassed Mint in that category. It shows you your most up to date credit score, from both Equifax and TransUnion. It can also show you ways to possibly refinance loans for your house and car, which will increase your savings rate.

## Your Checking Account App

Any good checking account will come with an app. Download it. You probably have by now.

## All Credit Card Company Apps

Every credit card you can get will have an app of some kind. Downlaod it. You probably have by now.

## Mint

While this app isn't as useful as it has been in the past, it is still worth a download. Mint will compile all of your acounts onto one screen, which makes things really easy.

## Coinbase

For the crypto savvy. I keep my Emergency Fund in USD Coin.

## Venmo 

My favorite cash transferring app. I like it more than Cash App.
