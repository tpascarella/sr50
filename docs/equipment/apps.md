# Apps

These are the apps you should have on your phone.

## Your Checking Account App

Any good checking account will come with an app. Download it. You probably already have by.

## Apps from All Credit Cards You Have

Every credit card you can get will have an app of some kind. Download the app for each one.

## Credit Karma

Credit Karma is my favorite app to keep track of my credit score, it has officially surpassed Mint in that category. 

It shows you your most up to date credit score, from both Equifax and TransUnion. It can also show you offers to refinance loans for your house and car if that would be of benefit to you, which in turn will increase your savings rate.

## Coinbase or Gemini

For the crypto savvy.

## Some Cash Transferring App 

My personal favorite is Venmo, but Cash App works too.
