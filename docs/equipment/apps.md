# Apps

These are the apps you should have on your phone.

## Your Checking Account App

Any good checking account will come with an app. Download it. You probably have by now.

## Credit Card Company Apps

Every credit card you can get will have an app of some kind. Download the app for each one.

## Mint

While Mint isn't as useful as it has been in the past, it is still worth a download. Mint will compile all of your acounts onto one screen, which makes tracking all of them really simple.

## Credit Karma

Credit Karma is my favorite app to keep track of my credit score, it has officially surpassed Mint in that category. It shows you your most up to date credit score, from both Equifax and TransUnion. It can also show you offers to refinance loans for your house and car if that would be of benefit to you, which in turn will increase your savings rate.

## Coinbase

For the crypto savvy. I keep my Emergency Fund in USD Coin.

## A Cash Transferring App 

My personal favorite is Venmo, but whatever you use is fine.
