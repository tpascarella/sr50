# Apps

These are the apps you should download onto your phone.

## Checking Account App

Any decent checking account will come with an app. Download it. You probably already have.

## Apps from All Credit Cards

Every credit card you can get will come with an app. Download it. Youprobably already have.

## Credit Karma

Credit Karma is my favorite app to keep track of my credit score, it has officially surpassed Mint in that category. It shows you your most up to date credit score, from both Equifax and TransUnion. 

It can also show you offers to refinance loans for your house and car if that would be of benefit to you.
