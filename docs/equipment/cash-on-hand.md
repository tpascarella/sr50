# Cash on Hand

## In Your Wallet

It's useful to have $60 in change in your wallet for anything that comes up. 
- 1 $20
- 2 $10s
- 2 $5s
- 10 $10s

This should be enough to cover your needs in 99% of circumstances.

## In Your House

It's also useful to have a stack of $20s hidden away somewhere. If your car gets towed, or anything else comes up that you can't use a card for, this is useful.
