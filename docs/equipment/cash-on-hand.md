# Cash on Hand

There will come times where you need to get your hands on some cash in a pinch.

## How Much Cash to Keep In Your Wallet

It's useful to keep $60 in change in your wallet. Use the following denominations:
- 1 $20
- 2 $10s
- 2 $5s
- 10 $1s

This should be enough to cover your needs in 99% of circumstances.

## How Much Cash to Keep In Your House

It's also useful to have a stack of $20s hidden away somewhere. If your car gets towed, or anything else comes up that you can't use a card for, this is useful.

## ATM/Debit Card

If you aren't willing to keep cash on hand, you at least need to be able to grab some from the ATM at a moment's notice.
