# Checking Account

A checking account is the digital connection you have to your money, so you will want a good one.

## How to Find a Good One

[Nerdwallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/rates/banking/checking-accounts?trk=nw_gn_5.0) has unbiased reviews of all major checking accounts. Pick one from there.

The minimum you should be willing to accept is:

- No fees of any kind. Because you can.

- EITHER unlimited ATM reimbursement or generous overdraft protection.

>Go with the ATM reimbursement. Most people want to travel when they become wealthy and overdraft charges are for amateurs.

## How Much Should I Keep There?

Ideally at least a month's worth of expenses plus a buffer of, at least, $500.
