# Checking Account

>Get one that doesn't suck.

Your checking account is the digital connection you have to your money, so you will want a good one.That bank in the grocery store that you opened a checking account with when you were 16 for your first job at Jimmy Johns, was fine back when you were 16. But you're not 16 anymore, you're an adult. 

Adults can do better.

## Where to Find a Good Checking Account

[Nerdwallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/rates/banking/checking-accounts?trk=nw_gn_5.0) has unbiased reviews of all major checking accounts. Pick any one of those and you'll probably be fine.

### - What to look for in a checking account

No fees of any kind (because you can), and EITHER:
- unlimited worldwide ATM reimbursements
- or generous overdraft protection

:::tip 

Go with the ATM reimbursement. Many people will want to travel when they become wealthy, and overdraft charges are for amateurs.

## What Should My Checking Account Balance Be?

You want *at least* one month's worth of expenses plus a buffer of at least $500. You will have access to liquidity through your emergency fund, so this should just be enough to cover automatic withdrawals.

### - Use credit cards for purchases

Use credit cards for purchases because of the fraud protections and [rewards](/credit/travel-hacking.md) they give. If your debit card is used fraudulently it is very unlikely youâ€™ll get the funds back. Use your checking account as the bucket in which credit card payments are withdrawn from.
