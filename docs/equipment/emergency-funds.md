# Emergency Fund

What people call "emergency funds" are really just the first few months of you Runway. 

You can keep this money in a savings account, a money market account, or in Cryptocurrency. 

:::tip

The only rule is that you need to keep it in a place where you can get the funds into your checking account quickly and without penalty.

## Where to Find Good Savings Accounts

[Nerdwallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/?trk=nw_gn_5.0) has unbiased reviews on all major savings accounts. Pick one of those and you'll be fine.

If your checking account is at a financial institution like Fidelity or Schwab, you also have the option of keeping your money in a money market account in the included brokerage account. This also a fine option.

## Investment Options

You can keep your emergency savings in cash in a savings account, or take the risk of higher volatility to get more of a return.

The following are potential options to park your emergency savings:

### (HIGH VOLATILITY) Established cryptocurrencies

If you're up for the roller coaster of volatility that the crypto market offers, keeping your Emergency Savings in *stable, established coins with a strong track record and are proven to not be scams* (Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two best) can yield the highest return for your months of Runway.

If you store your Bitcoin in Coinbase, you can borrow 40% of the balance in cash.

This gives you similar liquidity while maximizing the return on your capital.

### (MEDIUM VOLATILITY) Index funds

Index funds are a less aggressive approach, but will still likely yield higher returns than interest in a savings account, or on your stablecoins.

- [VBTLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VBTLX) from Vanguard is the best bond index fund.

You will need a minimum investment of $3000 to invest in these funds.

### (LOW/ZERO VOLATILITY) Savings accounts / Money market accounts / Stablecoins 

These options do not provide much (if any) return, so as your financial picture improves you should migrate this capital into higher yield assets.

You'll likely have to start with one of these options if you have fewer resources and less money. 

## How Much to Keep In Savings

Opinions vary, but in general, people recommend keeping 3-6 months of expenses available, but some say as much as one year. 

:::tip There is no "best" emergency fund balance

The best emergency fund balance is whatever will help you sleep best at night. 

If that's 3 months, it's 3 months. If you need 12, you need 12. It's entirely up to you.

:::

### A good starting template

I recommend keeping $10,000 in savings for every adult you are responsible for, and $5,000 for every child you are responsible. (you can include all of your pets as one child in this example)

So for a set of parents with 3 children that are dependent on them, a $25,000 emergency fund is a reasonable starting point. You will adjust this number as you learn your situation better, but this is a nice and easy rule of thumb.

## Migrate This Into Higher Yielding Assets Over Time

As time passes, your purchasing power with your dollars decreases due to inflation, which means that as time goes on and your purchasing and borrowing power increases, you should begin migrating this capital into higher yield assets.
