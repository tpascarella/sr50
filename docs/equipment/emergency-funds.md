# Emergency Funds

What people call "emergency funds" are just the first few months of you Runway. You can keep this money in a Savings Account, a specific Money Market Account, or in Cryptocurrency. 

The only rule is that you need to keep it in a place where you can convert it into cash into your checking account quickly and efficiently.

## Which Accounts to Choose

[Nerdwallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/?trk=nw_gn_5.0) has unbiased reviews on all major savings accounts. Pick one from there.

If you have your checking account at a financial institution like Fidelity or Schwab, you also have the option of keeping your money in a money market account in the included brokerage account. This also a fine option.

### (HIGH VOLATILITY) Cryptocurrency

If you're up for the roller coaster of volatility that the crypto market offers, keeping your Emergency Savings in *stable, established coins with a strong track record and are proven to not be scams* can yield the highest return for your months of Runway.

You can borrow cash using your Bitcoin as collateral from Coinbase. This gives your same liquidity option while maximizing the efficiency of your principal capital.

### (MEDIUM VOLATILITY) Index Funds

Index funds are a less aggressive approach, but will still likely yield higher returns than interest in a savings account, or on your stablecoins.

VTSAX from Vanguard is the best Stock index fund.

### (LOW/NO VOLATILITY) Savings Accounts / Money Market Accounts / Stablecoins 

You'll likely have to start with one of these options if you have fewer resources and less money. 

While you hold your money in these assets, you are being taxed by inflation, and therefore should migrate your capital over time into higher leverage assets as your borrowing power increases.

## How Much to Keep In These Accounts

Opinions vary, but generally people recommend a minimum of 3-6 months of expenses, but some say as much as a full year. 

:::tip The Best Emergency Fund Amount

The best emergency fund amount is whatever will make you sleep best at night. If that's 3 months, it's 3 months. If you need 12, you need 12. 

It's entirely up to you.

### A Good Starter Template

I recommend keeping $10,000 in savings for every adult you are responsible for, and $5,000 for every child you are responsible (at first). (you can include all of your pets as one child in this example)

So for a set of parents with 3 children that are dependent on them, a $25,000 emergency fund is a reasonable starting point. You will adjust this as you learn more but this is a nice and easy rule of thumb.

### Migrate This Capital Into Higher Leverage Assets Over Time

The term "Emergency Fund" simply refers to the amount of cash you can get your hands on rapidly & without penalty. However you are not making any return on this capital, and as your financial position improves you should migrate this capital into higher leverage assets as time goes on.
