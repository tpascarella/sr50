# Emergency Fund

>A place where you can quickly and cheaply access savings.

What people call "emergency funds" are really just the first few months of your Runway. You can keep this money in a traditional savings account, a money market account, or in [Cryptocurrency](/investing/gen-z-investments/cryptocurrency.md). 

:::tip

The only rule is that you need to keep these funds in a place where you can get cash into your checking account quickly and without penalty.

## Where to Find Good Savings Accounts

[Nerdwallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/?trk=nw_gn_5.0) has unbiased reviews on all major savings accounts. Pick one of those and you'll probably be fine.

### - Brokerage accounts

If your checking account is at a financial institution like [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/cash-management/fidelity-cash-management-account/overview) or [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/checking), they also give you a free brokerage account where you can put your savings in a money market account with low fees. These are fine options.

## Investment Options

You can keep your emergency savings in cash in a savings account, or take the risk of higher volatility to get more of a return. The following are potential options to park your emergency savings:

### - (HIGH VOLATILITY) Established cryptocurrencies

If you're up for the roller coaster of volatility that the crypto market offers, keeping your Emergency Savings in *stable, established coins with strong track records* (Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two best) can yield the highest return for your months of Runway.

:::info Keeping Your EF in Bitcoin

If you store your Bitcoin in Coinbase, you can borrow 40% of the balance in cash. This gives you similar liquidity while maximizing the return on your capital.

:::

### - (MEDIUM VOLATILITY) Index funds

Index funds are a less aggressive approach, but will still likely yield higher returns than interest in a savings account, or on your stablecoins.

- [VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax) from Vanguard is the best stock index fund.
- [VBTLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VBTLX) from Vanguard is the best bond index fund.
>You will need a minimum investment of $3000 to invest in these funds.

</details>

### - (LOW/ZERO VOLATILITY) Savings accounts / Money market accounts / Stablecoins 

These options do not provide much (if any) return, so as your financial picture improves you should migrate this capital into higher yield assets. You'll likely have to start with one of these options if you have less money. 

## How Much to Keep In Savings

Opinions vary on this topic. Some people recommend keeping 3-6 months of expenses available, others say as much as a full year of expenses. 

:::tip There is no "best" emergency fund balance

**The best emergency fund balance is whatever will help you sleep best at night.** If that number is 3 months, it's 3 months. If you need 12, you need 12. It's entirely up to you.

:::

### - A good starting template

I recommend keeping $10,000 in savings for every adult you are responsible for, and $5,000 for every child you are responsible. (you can include all of your pets as one child in this example)

So for a set of parents with 3 children that are dependent on them, a $25,000 emergency fund is a reasonable starting point. You will adjust this number as you learn your financial situation better, but this is a nice and easy rule of thumb.

## Migrate Capital Into Higher Yielding Assets Over Time

As time passes, your purchasing power with your dollars decreases due to inflation, which means that as your purchasing and borrowing power increases, you should begin migrating this capital into higher yield assets.

[Our emergency fund is exactly $0.00](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/05/05/emergency-fund/) is a great article that explains the opportunity cost of keeping significant capital in low/no yield assets.
