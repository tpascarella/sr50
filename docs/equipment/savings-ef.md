# Savings Accounts / Emergency Funds

A savings account is where you keep your liquid reserves. What people call "emergency funds" are just the first few months of you Runway, and as such should be kept in a form, and in an account, where you can convert them into cash and get them into your checking account quickly and efficiently.

## Where to get These Accounts

[Nerdwallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/?trk=nw_gn_5.0) has unbiased reviews of all major savings accounts. Pick one from there.

You also have the option of keeping your money in a money market account at financial brokerage institutions, such as Fidelity and Schwab. These are fine options as well.

## Crypto

If you're up for the volatility that the crypto market offers, keeping your Emergency Savings in *stable, established coins with a strong track record and are proven to not be scams* can yield the highest return for your months of Runway.

I store my emergency fund in Etherium on a cold wallet.

## VTSAX

Index funds are a less aggressive approach, and will still likely yield higher returns than USD Coin, or definitely a savings account at a financial institution.

You're being taxed by inflation.

## How Much to Keep There

Reports vary, but generally people recommend a minimum of 3-6 months of expenses, but some say as much as a full year. 

Honestly whatever dollar amount can make you sleep soundly at night is good enough. If that's $5000, it's $5000. If its $30,000, it's $30,000. Your pick.

## A Good Starting Template

I recommend keeping $10,000 in savings for every adult you are responsible for, and $5,000 for every child you are responsible. You can include all of your pets as one child in this example.

So for a set of parents with 3 children that are dependent on them, a $25,000 emergency fund should be your starting target. You can always adjust up or down.
