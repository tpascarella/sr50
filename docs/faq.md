<details>
  <summary>What makes SR50 better than other financial advisor platforms?</summary>

A few things:
- Everything we teach is made freely available through this website, and our content is [constantly being updated and refined](https://github.com/tpascarella/sr50/commits/main).
- We focus on improving our users' Savings Rate, as opposed to Net Worth. If you optimize for [Savings Rate](/kpis/primary/savings-rate.md) you can reach the same level of financial independence within 3-5 years, as it would take 35-40 years using a typical financial advisor approach.
- We DO NOT sell insurance or shitty investment products like all other [financial advisors.](problems.md)
- We NEVER sell user data.
