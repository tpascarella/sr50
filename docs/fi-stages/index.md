# The 8 Stages of Financial Independence

The wealth building journey has 8 stages. 
>Each stage is defined by **cash flow!** **These are NOT Net Worth milestones!**

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>

:::note First stage is stage zero

The reason that the list starts from 0 instead of 1, is because the FI community has deep roots in the software engineering and computer science communities, and they both start lists at 0.
