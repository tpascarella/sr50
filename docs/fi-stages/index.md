# The 8 Stages of Financial Independence

Wealth has 8 predefined stages.

From abject third world poverty all the way to Jeff Bezos, every human being on the planet falls in 1 of the 8. 

:::info First stage is stage zero

The reason that the list starts from 0 instead of 1, is because the FI community has deep roots in the software engineering and computer science communities, and they both start lists at 0.

:::

Each stage is defined by **cash flow!** **They are NOT Net Worth milestones!**
