# Stage 0

## Active Income < Lifestyle

Anyone whose active income (salary) cannot cover their lifestyle, and relies on family, friends, or a welfare check to support themselves are at Stage Zero. This is where everyone starts out, but Stage Zero isnâ€™t just limited to children living at home. 

>The reason the first stage is stage zero instead of stage one, is because the FI community has deep roots in the engineering community, and computer science people start lists from zero.

The only way out of Stage Zero is to increase your income or reduce your Burn until you can support yourself, there is no other way. 

### Get out of this stage as fast as possible.
