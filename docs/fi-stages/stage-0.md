## Complete Financial Dependence

### - Active Income < Lifestyle Expenses

Anyone whose active income (salary) cannot cover their lifestyle, and relies on family, friends, or a welfare check to support themselves are at Stage 0. This is where everyone starts out, but Stage 0 isnâ€™t just limited to children living at home. 

The only way out of Stage 0 is to increase your income or reduce your Burn until you can support yourself. **There is no other way.**

Get out of this stage as fast as possible!
