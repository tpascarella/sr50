## Financial Solvency

### - Active Income > Lifestyle Expenses

Stage 1 happens when someoneâ€™s active income can roughly cover their lifestyle expenses. 

At Stage 1, you are able to support yourself, but your Savings Rate is still 0%, and as a result you are not extending your Runway. 

:::caution

People at Stage 1 are trapped in an endless cycle of: earn money, spend everything, go back to work, repeat indefinitely.

:::

Being at Stage 1 is better than being at Stage 0, but the lack of Runway leaves people at this stage with still few options. 

**The only way out of this stage is to increase the gap between cash coming in and cash going out.**

:::danger 

Get out of this stage as fast as possible!
