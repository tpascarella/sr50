# Stage 1

## Financial Solvency

### - Active Income > Lifestyle Expenses

Stage One happens when someoneâ€™s active income can roughly cover their lifestyle expenses. 

At Stage One, you are able to support yourself, but your Savings Rate is still zero, and as a result you are not extending your Runway. 

:::caution

People at Stage One are trapped in an endless cycle of: earn money, spend everything, go back to work, repeat until death.

:::

Being at Stage One is better than being at Stage Zero, but the lack of Runway leaves people at this stage with still few options. 

The only way out of this stage is to increase the gap between cash in and cash out. 

:::danger 

Get out of this stage as fast as possible.
