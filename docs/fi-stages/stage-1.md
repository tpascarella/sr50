# Stage 1

## Active Income ≈ Lifestyle

Stage One happens when someone’s active income can roughly cover their lifestyle expenses. However at Stage One, your Savings Rate is still zero, and as a result you are not extending your Runway. You likely have little or no Runway to begin with. People at Stage One are trapped in the endless cycle of: earn money, spend everything, go back to work, and repeat.

Being at Stage One is better than being at Stage Zero, there's no self-respect in being unable to provide for yourself, but the lack of Runway leaves this person with still few options. The only way out of this stage is to increase the gap between cash in and cash out, and build up some Runway. 

### Get out of this stage as fast as possible.
