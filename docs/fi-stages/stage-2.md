# Stage 2

## Self Sufficiency + Savings

Stage Two happens once active income is greater than current lifestyle expenses, but *now* this person has some Runway underneath them. Stage Two is a moderately comfortable place to be, you have a small buffer between you and the money cliff, but you still have no passive income and are completely reliant on your paycheck.

:::info 

Many people believe that getting to Stage Two and maxing out their retirement accounts means you are doing *everything you can* to be financially responsible (almost as if they don't know of anything past this stage...) 

Do not get complacent at this stage! There is still a lot of work to be done.

:::

The focus for the person at Stage 2 is to eliminate their debts, and begin making strategic moves to increase their Savings Rate as much as they can. House Hacking is an appropriate option for people at this stage, as well as a possible career change. 

:::caution

Note that the "work 'til you're 65" life plan won't get you past Stage 2.
