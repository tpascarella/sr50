# Stage 3

## Debt Freedom (mortgage optional)

This stage happens once active income is enough to support current lifestyle expenses, some Runway has been saved, and bad debts have been eliminated from their financial picture. Whether mortgage or student loan debts are included here is up to you. 

You need to understand the difference between “good” debts and “bad” debts here. "Good" debts are debts at low interest rates which you can tactfully use to increase your Savings Rate. Examples of good debts include mortgages on rental properties, Student Loans to get a degree that will actually increase your income, and prime car loans in order to get to work and make money. These are not the worst things in the world to have, and can be left alone for now. These debts should never be accrued excessively or needlessly, however. 

"Bad" debts include high interest debt from things like credit cards, subprime car loans, payday loans, or any personal loans to friends or family. These debts do you absolutely no good, so get rid of them as fast as you can. The best method to pay bad debts off is called the Debt Snowball, which we'll cover in "The Stuff You'll Need" chapter.

If you are a Ramsey fan, you might argue that this Stage should precede Stage 2. However I think the Runway you have is more valuable than paying off your debts 3 months sooner. However it doesn't make a big difference either way.
