# Stage 4

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

## Financial Security (AKA Ramen Profitability)

### - Passive Income > Survival Expenses 

Stage 4 happens once passive income can cover barebones survival expenses. 

**Barebones Survival Expenses Include:**
- shelter, 
- food, 
- water, 
- insurance

This is the first point (mathematically) where you have *complete control over your time*, and the first moment where the FFE is solved!. In the startup world, this point is known as Ramen Profitability. 

>This is the most important threshold along your wealth building journey. 

Having enough passive income to cover survival expenses is a huge accomplishment that you should celebrate! You wonâ€™t stay at Stage 4 forever, but you have a *wealth of choice* available to you that few others will ever have.
