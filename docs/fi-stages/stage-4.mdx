# Stage 4

## Lean FI - Passive Income > Survival Expenses 

Stage Four (Lean FI as it’s known) happens once passive income can cover your barebones survival expenses. Barebones survival expenses include:
- shelter, 
- food, 
- water, 
- insurance 

This is the first point, mathematically, where you have complete control over your time. Having enough passive income to cover survival expenses is a huge accomplishment that you should be proud of! You won’t stay at this stage forever, but you have a wealth of choice available to you that very few others have. 

In the startup world, this point is known as Ramen Profitability, and it's the point where you don't need investors' (your employer's) permission to continue existing. This is the most important threshold along your wealth building journey!

A few house hacks or a rental property or two is usually all it takes to get you here. It's really not that hard.
