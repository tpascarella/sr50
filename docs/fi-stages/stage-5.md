# Stage 5

## Financial Independence

>Also known as Regular FI

### Passive Income > Lifestyle Expenses 

Stage Five (known as Regular FI) happens once passive income exceeds a desired lifestyle. Here, you can include the weekly movie dates with friends, all the subscription services your heart desires, the newest iPhone every year, your gym membership, and so on.

Stage Five isnâ€™t too far past Stage Four, so just keep the trajectory going a little longer and pretty soon these expenses will be covered as well.
