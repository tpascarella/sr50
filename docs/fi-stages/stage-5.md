# Stage 5

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

## Financial Independence (AKA Regular FI)

### - Passive Income > Lifestyle Expenses 

Stage 5 (Regular FI) occurs once passive income exceeds a desired lifestyle. Here, you can include the weekly movie dates with friends, all the subscription services your heart desires, the newest iPhone every year, your gym membership, and so on.

Stage 5 isn’t too far past Stage 4, so just keep the trajectory going a little longer and pretty soon these expenses will be covered as well.
