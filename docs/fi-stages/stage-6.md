## Financial Freedom

### - Passive Income > Big Life Goals

:::tip

Stage 6 is when you can get your Tesla.

:::

At Stage 6 you have enough passive income so that your lifestyle is covered with a comfortable margin of safety, and you have enough leftover to splurge on fancy cars, a condo in the city, designer clothes, groceries from Whole Foods, anything you want. 

Though while having fancy shit is nice, your attention should really pivot towards the development of your character. Itâ€™s smart to begin thinking about what your life will look like once you get to this stage, and to plan for that now.
