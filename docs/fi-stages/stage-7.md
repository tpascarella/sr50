## Financial Abundance

### - “I couldn’t spend it even if I tried”

By Stage 7, you need to plan beyond your own lifespan. You’ll need to set up an estate, a will, and a [Legacy Binder](/lifestyle/legacy-binder.md). You’re going to have far more money than you could ever possibly spend or ever know what to do with, make sure it's put to good use.

:::tip

Personal finance is personal responsibility, become someone capable of handling that responsibility.
