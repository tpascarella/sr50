# Stage 7

## “I couldn’t spend it even if I tried”

By Stage Seven, you need to plan beyond your own lifespan. You’ll need to set up an estate, a trust, and a will, minimum. You’re going to have far more money than you could ever possibly spend or ever know what to do with. Make sure it's put to good use.

I genuinely pity people who win the lottery. Almost always they aren’t prepared to handle the responsibility that comes along with that, and if you aren't careful your bad habits can easily get out of hand. Personal finance is personal responsibility, turn yourself into someone who can handle it.
