# Stage 5

Passive Income > Lifestyle Expenses (Regular FI)

Stage Five (known as Regular FI) happens once passive income exceeds a desired lifestyle. Here, you can include the weekly movie dates with friends, all the subscription services your heart desires, the newest iPhone every year, your gym membership, and so on.

Stage Five isnâ€™t too far past Stage Four, so just keep the trajectory going a little longer and pretty soon these expenses will be covered as well. Compounding is really starting to pick up at this point and you will be hard to slow down.
