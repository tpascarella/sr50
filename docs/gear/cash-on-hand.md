# Cash on Hand

## Cash in Your Wallet

It's useful to have $60 in change on you, or at least within reach. 
- 1 $20
- 2 $10s
- 2 $5s
- 10 $10s

This should be enough to cover your needs in most circumstances.

## Cash in Your House

It's also useful to have $200 in $20s hidden away somewhere. If anything bigger comes along and for some reason you need to have cash because you have no other access to your money, this is useful.
