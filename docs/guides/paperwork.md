# Organizing Paperwork

>Keeping documents safe and organized.

Certain documents require certain extra protections and privacy. Other documents you can simply leave in a Dropbox account and everything will be fine.

## Non-Sensitive Documents

Google Drive's 15gb free plan is useful for storing these documents.

## Sensitive Documents

Examples of sensitive documents include:
- Microsoft OneDrive & Microsoft Authenticator
- Dropbox Vault (Requires Dropbox Plus subscription)

Store these files in an online storage provider using 2 factor authentication. Keep it where you think it is least likely to get hacked.

### Crypto private keys

DO NOT STORE YOUR CRYPTO PRIVATE KEYS DIGITALLY. DO NOT TAKE PICTURES OF THEM. KEEP THEM 100% OFFLINE AND SECURE IN A FIREPROOF SAFE.

"Not your keys, not your coins" is a common phrase in the crypto world. You should keep your private keys completely offline, and ideally in multiple locations.

### Tax documents

Keep a dedicated binder with the previous 7 years worth of tax forms, and store the binder in a fireproof safe.
