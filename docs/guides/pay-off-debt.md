# Paying Off Credit Card Debt

Credit card debt is notorious for high interest rates and predatory behavior by debt collectors. Banlruptcy is also something you want no part of.

## Debt Snowball

One method of tacking credit card debt is the Debt Snowball, coined by Dave Ramsey. Here is how it works:

- List all debts smallest to largest by balance.

- Pay minimum payments except for the smallest balance.

- Throw every dollar at the smallest until it's dead. You then roll over the payment into number 2.

- Repeat until all debts have been paid this way.

## Debt Avalanche

The Debt Avalanche is another approach where the only difference is you list all of your debts highest to lowest, by interest rate. You pay off the highest interest rate one first and then move down to the smaller debts.

## Use the Snowball

The quick wins aspect of the Debt Snowball make it the superior debt paydown strategy.
