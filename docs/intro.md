# Intro

## "Work 'til You're 65" Does Not Apply Anymore

Your parents' advice of "Get a job, put 15% into a 401k, and work that job until you're 65" is does not apply anymore. 

Your parents lived in an era where an undergraduate degree was enough to get you a good job at a good company, and you could be reasonably sure you'll have job security for the rest of your life.

However, we are coming up in an era with automation breathing down our necks. The financial advice that might have worked in the 80s, is no longer relevant.

## A Different Financial Philosophy

It's not all bad though! We have access to Google, and there exists a community of personal finance nerds such as myself, who have dedicated their time to uncover every strategy, tactic, and unfair advantage related to personal finance, and they have made it freely available online. We are known colloquially as, the FI community (pronounced like "eye")

They focus on getting users' [Savings Rate](/kpis/savings-rate.md) as high as we can get it, and invest that money as aggresively as possible so that you don't have to trade your time for money any longer than is absolutely necessary.

The SR50 method is the culmination of all the best personal finance advice that the FI community has released, and it has been organized into one website someone can read through within an hour.

## Everything is About Getting Your Time Back 

Time is the only resource you can never buy more of. 

It is for this reason that time is the most important *thing* that money can buy. The *whole point* of personal finance is to reach to a place where you never need to trade your time for money again, and we will be focusing on reaching that point as early in life as possible.

## The Financial Freedom Equation

You become Financially Free once the financial freedom equation is satisfied. The financial freedom is as follows:

This is the first point where you don't need your employer's permission to sustain your lifestyle. As you'll soon find out, that is determined by how high you can get your Savings Rate.

>The Financial Freedom Equation will be referred to as the FFE moving forward.

## Passive Income vs Active Income

Passive Income, is any money coming in that you don’t have to trade your time and energy for. This is opposed to *Active Income*, which is money coming in that you do need to trade your time and energy for. (your salary falls under this category)

In other words, if it costs you $2500/month to live your desired lifestyle, but you have $5000/month coming in whether you get out of bed in the morning or not because you have bought or built assets that provide passive income, you no longer need your job. You don’t need to do what your boss tells you. You can walk away from your paycheck *consequence free.* 

## F-You Money, a Mindset

F-You money is any amount of money that allows you to be bolder with your decisions. 

It's a threshold on your wealth building journey, and it goes by many names, 
- Financial Independence, 
- Financial Freedom, 
- Early Retirement,
but my personal favorite is:
- F-You money. 
*you can use your imagination to figure out what the F stands for.*

People talk about financial independence like it's *a math problem*, but it isn't. Financial independence is a psychology problem. It's about having enough money that you don't have to submit to your employer or your paycheck.

## What Actual Financial Freedom is Like

The most important thing money can buy is freedom. Freedom to live where you want, work where you want, and for whom you want. It means having the ability to walk away from your paycheck consequence free. 

But this freedom only comes from having cash flow, and enough Runway to give you time to pursue opportunities as desired.

Think of it this way, 

**Which would be more useful to you?** 

- A million dollars in a 401K that you can’t touch for the next 40 years 
- 10 grand deposited into your checking account every single month starting right now?

I like option 2.

## Takeaway

Take as high of a percentage of dollars that you can, and invest it aggressively, but not irresponsibly, until you build up enough passive income so that the financial freedom equation is satisfied.
