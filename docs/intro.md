# Intro

## "Work 'til You're 65" Doesn't Exist Anymore

Your parents' advice of "Get a job, put money in retirement accounts, and work that job until you're 65" is horrible advice. You have no money at all during the best years of your life and wait like a good little cog until 65 for your big payday?

![That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.](/img/rickandmorty.svg)

In an era where Google exists, we are certainly capable of creating a financial plan that can serve us much better, much faster.

## Everything is About Getting Your Time Back 

Time is the only resource you can never buy more of. 

It is for this reason that the *whole point* of personal finance is to get to a place where you never need to trade your time for money again. 

## The Financial Freedom Equation

You reach this point once the financial freedom equation is satisfied. The financial freedom is as follows:

This is the first point where you don't need your employer's permission to stay alive. You don't have to trade your time and energy to support yourself.

## Passive Income vs Active Income

Passive Income is any money coming in that you don’t have to trade your time and energy for. This is opposed to Active Income, which is money coming in that you do need to trade your time and energy for. (your salary falls under this category)

So, if it costs you $2500/month to live, but you have $5000/month coming in whether you get out of bed in the morning or not, you no longer need your job. You don’t need to do what your boss tells you. You can walk away from your paycheck consequence free. Those 40 hours a week are suddenly back under your control, and it would be in your best interest to reach this point as soon as possible.

## F-You Money, a Mindset

This point at which you get your time back is a threshold on your wealth building journey, and it goes by many names, 
* Financial Independence, 
* Financial Freedom, 
* Early Retirement,

but my personal favorite is:
* F-You money. 
*you can use your imagination to figure out what the F stands for.*

F-You Money is a mindset as much as anything. People talk about financial independence like it *is a math problem*, but it isn't. The math behind it is, conceptually, very simple. Financial independence is a psychology problem. It is refusing to submit to your employer or your paycheck.

## What Actual Financial Freedom is Like

The most important thing money can buy is freedom. Freedom to live where you want, work where you want, and for whom you want. It means having the ability to walk away from your paycheck consequence free. 

But this freedom only comes from having a stable cash flow situation, and enough Runway to give you time to pursue opportunities as desired.

Think of it this way, 

**Which would be more useful to you?** 

- A million dollars in a 401K that you can’t touch for the next 40 years 
- 10 grand deposited into your checking account every single month starting right now?

I like option 2.

That is what the SR50 Method will be trying to achieve.
