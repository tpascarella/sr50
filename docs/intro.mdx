# Introduction

## An Open Source Financial Advisor Alternative

SR50 is a distillation of all the best personal finance information you can find on the internet. We have taken the time to uncover every single strategy, tactic, and unfair advantage related to personal finance, and have organized it into a free and open source documentation website.

## FAQs

<details>
  <summary>What makes SR50 better than other financial advisor platforms?</summary>

A few things:
- Everything we teach is made freely available through this website, and our content is [constantly being updated and refined](https://github.com/tpascarella/sr50/commits/main).
- We focus on improving our users' Savings Rate, as opposed to Net Worth. If you optimize for [Savings Rate](/kpis/savings-rate.md) you can reach the same level of financial independence within 3-5 years, as it would take 35-40 years using a typical financial advisor approach.
- We DO NOT sell insurance or shitty investment products like all other [financial advisors.](problems.md)
- We NEVER sell user data.
