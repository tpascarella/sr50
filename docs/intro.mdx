# Introduction

## SR50 is an Open Source Financial Advisor Alternative

SR50 is specifically competing against established financial advisor firms.

We compile all of the best information on Google, and present it through this website. It's basically if the world's best financial advisor published everything they knew on a website that was constantly getting updates and being improved.

### How We Compare To Traditional Financial Advisors

<details>
  <summary>What makes SR50 better than other financial advisor platforms?</summary>

A few things:
- We open source everything we teach, and our educational material is constantly being updated and refined.
- 100% transparency about how we make money. We have an Open Collective page that you can back if you choose to.
- We focus on improving Savings Rate, as opposed to Net Worth. Savings Rate is the most important KPI in personal finance, and if you optimize for Savings Rate you can reach the same level of financial independence in 3-5 years, as would take 35-40 years using a typical financial advisor approach.

<details>
  <summary>How is it free? What's the catch?</summary>

We make money through a freemium model. The website is an open source documentation project that anyone can contribute to. Meaning, everything we teach is made available to everyone, even if they aren't a user.

We have a paid subscription option that provides software tools that implement with the educational content on the website, as well as priority when it comes to integrating user feeedback, but all of the information is freely available on this website.

## What Actual Financial Freedom is Like

The most important thing money can buy is freedom. Freedom to live where you want, work where you want, and for whom you want. It means having the ability to walk away from your paycheck consequence free. 

But this freedom only comes from having cash flow, and enough Runway to give you time to pursue opportunities as desired.

Think of it like this.

- A million dollars in a 401K that you can't touch for the next 40 years.
- 10 grand deposited into your checking account every month, starting right now?

I like option 2.

### Passive Income vs Active Income

Passive Income, is any money coming in that you don’t have to trade your time and energy for. This is opposed to *Active Income*, which is money coming in that you do need to trade your time and energy for. (your salary falls under this category)

In other words, if it costs you $2500/month to live your desired lifestyle, but you have $5000/month coming in whether you get out of bed in the morning or not because you have bought or built assets that provide passive income, you no longer need your job. You don’t need to do what your boss tells you. You can walk away from your paycheck *consequence free.* 

### F-You Money

F-You money is any amount of money that allows you to be bolder with your decisions. 

It's a threshold on your wealth building journey, and it goes by many names, 
- Financial Independence, 
- Financial Freedom, 
- Early Retirement,
but my personal favorite is:
- F-You money. 
*you can use your imagination to figure out what the F stands for.*

People talk about financial independence like it's *a math problem*, but it isn't. Financial independence is a psychology problem. It's about having enough money that you don't have to submit to your employer or your paycheck.

### A Completely Different Financial Philosophy

There exists a community of personal finance nerds such as myself, who have dedicated their time to uncover every strategy, tactic, and unfair advantage related to personal finance, and they have made it freely available online. We are known colloquially as, the FI community (pronounced like "eye")

Their focus is on getting users' [Savings Rates](/kpis/savings-rate.md) as high as they can, and invest that money as aggresively as possible so that you don't have to trade your time for money any longer than is absolutely necessary.

The SR50 method is the culmination of all the best personal finance advice that the FI community has released, and it has been organized into one website someone can read through within an hour.

## Takeaways

:::note 

- You want to have the ability to save a very high percentage of your income, and then invest that money aggresively (but not irresponsibly) until you build up enough passive income so that the Financial Freedom Equation is satisfied.
- Once that point is crossed, you never again need to rely on your employer to sustain you financially, and your 40 hours a week are now back under your control.
