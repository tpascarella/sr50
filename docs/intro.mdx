## FAQs

<details>
  <summary>What makes SR50 better than other financial advisor platforms?</summary>

A few things:
- We make everything we teach freely available, and our educational material is [constantly being updated and refined](https://github.com/tpascarella/sr50/commits/main).
- We focus on improving users' Savings Rate, as opposed to Net Worth. [If you optimize for Savings Rate you can reach the same level of financial independence in just 3-5 years, as would take 35-40 years using a typical financial advisor approach.](/kpis/savings-rate.md)
- We do not sell insurance or shitty investment products like typical ["financial advisors."](problems.md)
