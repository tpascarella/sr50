### Common Questions

<details>
  <summary>What makes SR50 better than other financial advisor platforms?</summary>

A few things:
- We open source everything we teach, and our educational material is constantly being updated and refined as we obtain user feedback.
- We focus on improving users' Savings Rate, as opposed to Net Worth. Savings Rate is the most important KPI in personal finance, and if you optimize for Savings Rate you can reach the same level of financial independence in just 3-5 years, as would take 35-40 years using a typical financial advisor approach.

### What Actual Financial Freedom Looks Like

The most important thing money can buy is freedom. Freedom to live where you want, work where you want, and for whom you want. It means having the financial capacity to walk away from your paycheck consequence free. 

But this freedom only comes through having cash flow, and significant Runway saved up to pursue opportunities as desired. Think of it like this.

- A million dollars in a 401K that you can't touch for the next 40 years.
- 10 grand deposited into your checking account every month, starting right now?

I like option 2.

## "Passive" Income vs "Active" Income

Cash flow exists in 2 different forms, there is cash flow you obtain from trading your time, energy and cognitive resources (Active Income), and cash flow that you obtain as a reward for buying or building assets that provide cash flow (Passive Income).

In other words, if your lifestyle costs you $2500/month, but you have $5000/month coming in whether you get out of bed in the morning or not because you have acquired assets that provide passive income, you no longer need your job. You donâ€™t need to do what your boss tells you. 

You can walk away from your paycheck *consequence free.* (This is what you want.)

### "F-You Money"

There are many names for the point in time where that cash flow threshold is crossed, including: 

- Financial Independence, 
- Financial Freedom, 
- Early Retirement,

:::note My personal favorite

**F-You money.**

>You can use your imagination to figure out what the F stands for.

:::

People talk about personal finance like it's a **math problem**, but it isn't. Financial independence is a **psychology problem**. 

It's about having enough money to put yourself into a position where you never have to submit to your employer or your paycheck.

### An Entire Community Behind You

There exists a community of personal finance nerds such as myself, who have dedicated their time to uncover every single strategy, tactic, and unfair advantage related to personal finance, and all of this material is made freely avaibale online. 

We are known colloquially as the FI community.

:::note Pronunciation

"FI" pronounced like "eye".

:::

Our focus is to get individuals' [Savings Rates](/kpis/savings-rate.md) as high as we can, then invest that money as aggresively as possible into assets that produce the most passive income, so that you don't have to trade your time for money any longer than is absolutely necessary.

The SR50 method is the culmination of all the best personal finance advice that the FI community has released, I hope it proves valuable to you.
