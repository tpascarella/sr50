# Franchise Businesses

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

>Buying and operating a proven business.

:::danger Denominated in fiat

Franchises are only worth the discounted value of future cash flows, and since those cash flows are denominated in fiat money, the purchasing power of the cash flows, and subsequently the value of the business, will fall alongside it.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

:::tip Advantages

- Less risk than starting a business from scratch.
- Can provide reliable cash flow.
- Provides jobs and makes an impact in the local economy.

:::

:::danger Disadvantages

- Very high capital requirements. ($1M+ sometimes)
- Requires continual management from you or someone you hire.
- Fast food franchises requires managing fast food employees.

:::

## Prerequisities

Investing in franchises requires significantly more capital than real estate. You will need at least $100,000 saved up in order to get financing for one of these, and usually more than $500,000.

### - Deciding which franchise you want

[This article from NerdWallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/best-franchises) states the 15 best franchise opportunities for 2022. Begin here if you don't already know which franchise you would like to invest in.

### - Numbers aren't everything, lifestyle factors matter too

This is a marriage that you should be equally excited about 30 years from now as today. Don't let the cash flow numbers make the decision for you. I would never open a Jimmy John's franchise even tough it pays well. Not all money is good money! Some of it is just blood money. You bought yourself a crappy job if you invest in one of these because you have to deal with fast food employees and customers.

## Resources

[The Franchise Bible](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N95E8IW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) is the best book I have currently read on franchise investing.
