>Buying ownership of companies, and fixed future payments.

:::danger Denominated in fiat

Inflation is rising fast enough that investing in these assets might not outpace it. Consider that when deciding which asset class to invest in.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

:::tip Advantages

- Requires zero time to manage.
- Excellent diversification.
- Tax efficient.

:::

:::danger Disadvantages

- Low return relative to other asset classes. (around 8% per year)
- No unfair advantage potential.
- Requires at least 25X yearly expenses to reach FI.

:::

## The 4% Rule

You will need to save up 25X your yearly expenses, invested 50/50 in stocks and bonds, to reach FI. You then withdraw 4% of your portfolio per year to live off of. assuming a 7% annual return and 3% inflation, and historically this has shown to be a save withdrawal rate.

In a typical 30 year retirement, you have a 96% chance of not outliving your money, a 3% withdrawal rate (if you invest 33X yearly expenses) has had a 100% chance of not outliving your money in a 30 year retirement.

:::note

This 25X number is based on the famous [Trinity Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study), which analyzed 100+ years of market performance and retirement withdrawals. 

:::

The 4% rule is a *nice and easy rule of thumb* but should not be taken as the end all be all of retirement plans, (especially for FI people), but it’s a good number to start with. You can, and probably will, keep working past this point. 

### - Portfolio allocations for different wealth building stages

To satisfy the 4% rule, you will need at least one stock index fund and one bond index fund to invest in. Recommendations from different companies listed below.

#### - Wealth building phase

If you are still working and have a paycheck, I recommend investing as aggressively as you can and go 100% in US stocks. 
>This strategy comes from JL Collins's book, [The Simple Path to Wealth.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H97OQY2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

You can add an international stock index fund too, but you are diversified enough already and it's just overkill at that point.

#### - Wealth preservation phase

Once you’ve crossed the threshold of FI and are living off your portfolio, then I recommend a 75-25 stock/bond split in either direction depending on your risk tolerance.

## Index Funds

>"A low-cost index fund is the most sensible equity investment for the great majority of investors." - Warren Buffett

An index fund is a mutual fund that invests in a group of stocks according to a specific index. 

:::note

I assume you’ve heard of the S&P 500, right? The S&P 500 is an index that tracks the 500 largest publicly traded companies in America, that’s it. 

Meaning, if you invest in an S&P 500 index fund, you are investing in those same 500 companies, in the same proportions, as the S&P 500. 

:::

Index funds are the simplest, most powerful, most tax efficient, lowest time requirement investments you can ever make in this asset class. 

### - Watch out for expense ratios

Index funds are considered *passively managed funds* because all they do is follow what the index does. This is opposed to *actively managed funds*, which require full time managers and these can have expense ratios in excess of 1%.

:::caution 

A 1% expense ratio doesn’t sound too bad, but when compounded over decades it can be a real drag on your investment performance. We're talking a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars

:::

Index & mutual funds are considered “low cost” if their expense ratio is less than *one tenth of a percent*. Today, most index funds have expense ratios less than *five hundredths* of a percent. So look at the expense ratio of any fund you are planning on putting money into. If it is more than 1/10th of a percent (.1%), pick another fund.

### - Why are index funds so much cheaper than mutual funds?

There are a few key differences that make index funds considerably cheaper, including:
- any time stocks are bought and sold within the fund, that triggers a taxable event. These taxable events increase operating costs, 
- the *“professionals"* who manage the fund have hefty salaries and bonuses that need to be paid. This money is ciphoned from your investments, 
- marketing costs, office furniture, recruiting, etc. 

this money has to come from somewhere (you)!

Active fund managers not only have to outperform the index over time (astonishingly rare on its own), but they have to outperform the index with a big enough margin to cover the greatly inflated management costs. So do yourself a favor and just stick with index funds. Your great grandkids will thank you.

## Index Funds vs. ETFs

[There is no significant difference between Index Funds and ETFs.](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033015/whats-difference-between-index-fund-and-etf.asp#:~:text=The%20main%20difference%20between%20an,end%20of%20the%20trading%20day.) They are slightly different packaging for the same underlying investment product (Similar to different wrapping papers for the same underlying Christmas present).

### - I recommend index funds over ETFs

That being said, I do recommend you go with index funds over ETFs if you have the choice, simply because the fact that index funds close at the end of each trading day, instead of updating continuously over the course of the day like stocks. 

This gives you *ever so slightly* more friction against making an impulse sell, and I think that is worth the extra basis point in cost. You can also buy index funds in fractional amounts, whereas with ETFs you need to buy shares at their full market price, depending where you invest. 

>For example, if an ETF share is $140, but you had $1500 to invest, you could only buy $1400 worth ($140x10 shares) instead of $1500 in fractional shares using the index fund.

### - Use Vanguard if possible

Vanguard is the best option in the mutual fund industry because of their ownership structure. Vanguard is owned by the funds that make up Vanguard. And those funds are owned by the investors of those funds. Meaning you, as an *investor of Vanguard*, are also a *partial owner* of Vanguard. 

This is in sharp contrast to the rest of the mutual fund industry, which are owned by shareholders who expect to be paid out of the profits of their funds. Investors have caught onto this fact too. Here is a [New York Times excerpt](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/business/mutfund/vanguard-mutual-index-funds-growth.html) from 2017:

>“In the last three calendar years, investors sank $823 billion into Vanguard funds, the company says. The scale of that inflow becomes clear when it is compared with the rest of the mutual fund industry — more than 4,000 firms in total. All of them combined took in just a net $97 billion during that period, Morningstar data shows. Vanguard, in other words, scooped up about 8.5 times as much money as all of its competitors.”

So stick with Vanguard if you have the choice. They have some of the lowest expense ratios in the industry, and their core values are aligned with your best interests. 

## Optimizing Returns With Tax Advantaged Accounts

To squeeze the highest possible return out of your portfolio, max out your accounts in this order; 
- HSA (Health Savings Account) 
- Traditional IRA
- 401K
- Roth IRA
- Taxable brokerage account.

### - Use pre-tax dollars

As a general rule you want to invest pre-tax dollars before you invest post-tax dollars, because you will never get another chance to optimize this year's taxes. 

There are strategies you can use to pull the money out tax free later. [This article from the Mad Fientist](https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/) explains how to optimize taxes with these types of accounts.
