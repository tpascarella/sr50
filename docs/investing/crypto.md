# Cryptocurrency

Crypto is making a lot of headlines, and for good reason, the technology is actively disrupting central and commercial banks, and has very promising implications for the future. 

However, along with that, it has attracted a lot of unsavory individuals to this space. You do need to do your homework, you could potentially lose everything if you're not careful.

As a general rule, it is wise to put your money into something only if you can also explain to a 5 year old.

My current recommendation is to buy and hold into a diversified pool of tokens, from good founders. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two main options.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

:::tip Advantages

- Much higher ROI than stocks/bonds or real estate.
- The crypto revolution is happening whether you hop on board or not.

:::

:::danger Disadvantages

- Incredibly volatile.
- There are lots of shady characters in the crypto space. (Vast majority of ICOs are complete scams)

## Buy Bitcoin and Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the 2 most important cryptocurrencies.

They are essentially digital nations because they have their own currencies and contracts. Maximizing your crypto wealth means maximizing your net worth demoninated in these 2 assets.

### Is it too late to buy?

No! 

In the technology adoption curve, we are probably in the early adopter/early majority camp. There is still tremendous upside by investing in crypto. 

We're definitely paying higher valuations than people who bought Bitcoin back when it was $5, but we have far more educational resources and social validation that the technology is legit.

### Portfolio strategy

The simplest Crypto strategy is to go 50/50 BTC/ETH, skewing to 75/25 in either direction depending on personal preference. It is modeled after Benjamin Graham's portfolio from The Intelligent Investor.

There is no "best" portfolio allocation, as some would have you believe. You can't possibly know what the best portfolio allocation would be unless you have a time machine and can look 10 years into the future. The best bet you have is to make informed decisions about which tokens you are going to invest in, and dollar cost average for the long term.

### Putting my money where my mouth is

I would never advise you to invest in something if I wouldn't also invest in it myself. [Here is my current Coinbase portfolio if you would like to verify.](https://www.coinbase.com/portfolio/1a111208-34ea-4a02-beef-3b7f6d3102d6?utm_source=share&utm_platform=iOS)
