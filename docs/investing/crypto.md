# Crypto

I am still not entirely sure what to make of cryptocurrency at this time. My initial thought is to buy and hold into a diversified pool of tokens, from good founders. Bitcoin and Ethereum are good options, I also put money into Algorand, and have some liquidity in USDC.

I would be wary, as a general rule, of putting your money into something if you cannot also explain it to a 5 year old. 

## Buy BTC and ETH

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the 2 most important cryptocurrencies, and are essentially digital nations because they have their own currencies and contracts. Maximizing your crypto wealth means maximizing your net worth in these 2 assets
