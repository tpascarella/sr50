# Cryptocurrency

Crypto is making a lot of headlines, and for good reason, the technology is actively disrupting central and commercial banks, and has very promising implications for the future. 

However, along with that, it has attracted a lot of unsavory individuals to this space. You do need to do your homework, you could potentially lose everything if you're not careful.

As a general rule, it is wise to put your money into something only if you can also explain to a 5 year old.

My current recommendation is to buy and hold into a diversified pool of tokens, from good founders. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two main options.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

:::tip Advantages

- Much higher ROI than stocks/bonds or real estate.
- The crypto revolution is happening whether you hop on board or not.
- Self sovereignty.

:::danger Disadvantages

- Incredibly volatile.
- There are lots of shady characters in the crypto space. (Vast majority of ICOs are complete scams)

## Buy Bitcoin and Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the 2 most important cryptocurrencies.

They are essentially digital nations because they have their own currencies and contracts. Maximizing your crypto wealth means maximizing your net worth demoninated in these 2 assets.

### Is it too late to buy?

No! 

In the technology adoption curve, we are probably in the early adopter/early majority camp. There is still tremendous upside by investing in crypto. 

We are definitely paying higher valuations *now* than people who bought Bitcoin back when it was $5, but we have far more educational resources and social validation that the technology is legit.

### Portfolio strategy

There is no "best" portfolio allocation, as some would have you believe. You can't possibly know what the best portfolio allocation would be unless you have a time machine and can look 10 years into the future. The best bet you have is to make informed decisions about which tokens you are going to invest in, and dollar cost average for the long term.

The *simplest* Crypto strategy, and probably the best for most people is to go 50/50 BTC/ETH, skewing to 75/25 in either direction depending on personal preference. It is modeled after Benjamin Graham's portfolio from The Intelligent Investor.

Let BTC and ETH do the heavy lifting in your portfolio, if you want to take chances on some hail-mary coins, limit their total investment to 20% of your total portfolio.

## What You Should Do To Start Investing in Crypto

The first thing you should do is to commit to only putting your money into things that you *understand*. You can lose everything in crypto if you are careless.

Some practical tips: 
- Subscribe to [Bankless](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bankless?app=desktop) on YouTube and self educate constantly. Video recommendations included below.
- Create an account with [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/) and buy Bitcoin and/or Ethereum. 
- Buy a [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x) hardware wallet to store yout Bitcoin.
- Create accounts with [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/) and [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) to use your Ethereum in open finance.
- Dollar cost average your crypto investments over a long period of time.

### Psychological preparation

When I say the crypto markets are volatile, I mean they are *volatile*. Far more than you would have investing in the stock market through index funds.

If you invest your entire life savings into crypto and overnight it gets cut by 20% you need to make sure you are prepared to handle that.

**"I'm the worst investor of all time!"**

Don't throw *everything* you have at crypto when you first get excited about it. Mentally psych yourself up for the rollercoaster of volatility and learn to accept it. As long as you make sure you have enough cash to cover a few months of expenses available, and have a holding period of forever (you should) then the market volatility will be a little easier to swallow.
