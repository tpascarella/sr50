# Crypto

I am still not entirely sure what to make of cryptocurrency at this time. My initial thought is to buy and hold into a diversified pool of tokens, from good founders. Bitcoin and Ethereum are good options, I also put money into Algorand, and have some liquidity in USDC.

I would be wary, as a general rule, of putting your money into something if you cannot also explain it to a 5 year old.
