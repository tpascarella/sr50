# Crypto

I am still not entirely sure what to make of cryptocurrency at this time. My initial thought is to buy and hold into a diversified pool of tokens, from good founders. Bitcoin and Ethereum are good options, I also put money into Algorand, and have some liquidity in USDC.

I would be wary, as a general rule, of putting your money into something if you cannot also explain it to a 5 year old. 

## Buy BTC and ETH

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the 2 most important cryptocurrencies, and are essentially digital nations because they have their own currencies and contracts. Maximizing your crypto wealth means maximizing your net worth in these 2 assets

## Is It Too Late?

No! 

In the technology adoption curve, we are probably in the early adopter/early majority camp. We still have tremendous upside by investing in crypto. We are definitely paying higher valuations than people who bought Bitcoin when it was $5, but we have more educational resources and social validation that this is legit. 

## Portfolio Strategy

The simplest Crypto strategy is to go 50/50 BTC/ETH, skewing to 75/25 in either direction depending on your risk tolerance. It is modeled after Benjamin Graham's portfolio from The Intelligent Investor.

## Putting My Money Where My Mouth Is

I would never advise you to invest in something if I wouldn't also invest in it myself. [Here is my current Coinbase portfolio if you would like to verify.](https://www.coinbase.com/portfolio/1a111208-34ea-4a02-beef-3b7f6d3102d6?utm_source=share&utm_platform=iOS)
