# Cryptocurrency

Crypto is making a lot of headlines, and for good reason, the technology is actively disrupting central and commercial banks, and has very promising implications for the future. However, along with that, there are a lot of unsavory individuals in this space, and a majority of ICOs currently fall somewhere in between incompetence and scams. You do need to do your homework. You can potentially lose everything if you are not careful.

>As a general rule, it would be wise to put your money into something you can also explain to a 5 year old. 

My current recommendation is to buy and hold into a diversified pool of tokens, from good founders. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two main options, I also put money into Algorand. You can a link to my current portfolio at the bottom of the page.

## Buy Bitcoin and Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the 2 most important cryptocurrencies, and are essentially digital nations because they have their own currencies and contracts. Maximizing your crypto wealth means maximizing your net worth in these 2 assets

## Is It Too Late?

No! 

In the technology adoption curve, we are probably in the early adopter/early majority camp. We still have tremendous upside by investing in crypto. We are definitely paying higher valuations than people who bought Bitcoin when it was $5, but we have more educational resources and social validation that this is legit.

## Portfolio Strategy

The simplest Crypto strategy is to go 50/50 BTC/ETH, skewing to 75/25 in either direction depending on your risk tolerance. It is modeled after Benjamin Graham's portfolio from The Intelligent Investor.

## Putting My Money Where My Mouth Is

I would never advise you to invest in something if I wouldn't also invest in it myself. [Here is my current Coinbase portfolio if you would like to verify.](https://www.coinbase.com/portfolio/1a111208-34ea-4a02-beef-3b7f6d3102d6?utm_source=share&utm_platform=iOS)
