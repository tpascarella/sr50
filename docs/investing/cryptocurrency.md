## Importance

Crypto is making a lot of headlines and for good reason. The technology is actively disrupting central and commercial banks, and empowers individuals regardless of citizenship.

However, the impressive returns have attracted a lot of *unsavory individuals* into the space. You need to do your homework in crypto, you can lose everything **if you act carelessly.**

:::tip 

As a general rule, it is wise to only put your money into something if you can also explain to a 5 year old.

### - Nations die when their currency becomes worthless

[In 1971, the government made the dollar backed by nothing.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp) The only value the dollar has anymore is the "full faith and credit of the US Government." 

How much full faith and credit do you have in the US Government? Decide for yourself.

## Buy Bitcoin and Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the 2 most important cryptocurrencies. Maximizing your crypto wealth means maximizing your Net Worth demoninated in these 2 assets.

### - Isn't it too late to buy?

No! Absolutely not.

We are in the early stages of the technology adoption curve. Somewhere around the early adopter/early majority camp. There is still tremendous upside to investing in crypto. We are definitely paying higher prices than people who bought Bitcoin in the early 2010's, but we have far more educational content and social validation that the technology is legitimate.

#### - Get on it.

The longer you wait, the higher the prices will be. Obviously buying ETH *before* the merge is preferable to buying ETH *after* the merge. 

### - Portfolio strategy

There is no "best" portfolio allocation, as some will say. You can't know what the best portfolio allocation will be unless you have a time machine and can look 10 years into the future. *The best bet you have is to make informed decisions about which tokens you are going to invest in, and dollar cost average for the long term.*

My recommendation is to go 50/50 Bitcoin and Ethereum for your investment portfolio, and then use DAI to make purchases with a crypto visa card.

### - Crypto index funds

If you subscribe to the investment strategy of indexing, buy one or a few of the indexes listed below. Let the indexes do the heavy lifting in your portfolio. If after that you want to take chances on some hail-mary tokens, limit their total investment to 20% of your portfolio.

Crypto index funds to consider:
- [Bankless Bed Index (BED)](https://indexcoop.com/bankless-bed-index)
- [Data Economy Index (DATA)](https://indexcoop.com/data-economy-index)
- [DeFi Pulse Index (DPI)](https://indexcoop.com/defi-pulse-index-dpi)
- [Bankless DeFi Innovation Index (GMI)](https://indexcoop.com/bankless-defi-innovation-index-gmi)
- [Metaverse Index (MVI)](https://indexcoop.com/metaverse-index-mvi)

## TAKE PROPER PRECAUTIONS

There are some precautions you should take if you are a crypto beginner using their life savings:
- Only put your money into tokens that you **understand**, **believe in wholeheartedly**, and have **actual real world utility**. 
- SEND A TEST TRANSACTION BEFORE YOU SEND SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES. If you send your entire balance to the wrong address, you could lose your funds forever.
  >A guide for your first crypto transaction is included below.

### - How to not get scammed

There are a *lot* of shady characters in the crypto space, when there is potential for massive profit that will happen. Here are some rules to minimize the risk of getting taken advantage of:

- Does the token have a whitepaper? 
- Does the token have a proven track record?
- Does the token have a large liquidity pool?
- Does the token have distributed ownership?
- Does the token have actual utility?

### - Psychological preparation for the volatility

When I say the crypto markets are volatile, I mean they are *volatile*. Far more volatility than you will experience in the stock market through index funds.

:::caution Volatility

The only way to prepare for the volatility of the crypto markets is to experience it for yourself. 

Tie yourself to the ship, and to vow to **never sell out of fear.**
