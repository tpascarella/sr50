## Importance

Crypto is making a lot of headlines, and for good reason, the technology is actively disrupting central and commercial banks, and has very promising implications for the future. However, along with that, has attracted a lot of unsavory individuals to this space. You do need to do your homework in crypto. You could lose everything if you are not careful.

:::tip 

As a general rule, it is wise to put your money into something only if you can also explain to a 5 year old.

## Buy Bitcoin and Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the 2 most important cryptocurrencies. Maximizing your crypto wealth means maximizing your net worth demoninated in these 2 assets.

### - Is it too late to buy?

No! 

In the technology adoption curve, we are probably in the early adopter/early majority camp. There is still tremendous upside for investing in crypto. We are definitely paying higher prices than people who bought Bitcoin back when it was $5, but we have far more educational resources and social validation that the technology is legitimate.

Buying ETH *before* the merge is preferable to buying ETH *after* the merge. 

### - Portfolio strategy

There is no "best" portfolio allocation, as some will say. You can't possibly know what the best portfolio allocation would be unless you have a time machine and can look 10 years into the future. *The best bet you have is to make informed decisions about which tokens you are going to invest in, and dollar cost average for the long term.*

If you subscribe to the investment strategy of indexing, buy one or a few of the indexes listed below. Let the indexes do the heavy lifting in your portfolio. If after that you want to take chances on some hail-mary tokens, limit their total investment to 20% of your portfolio.

### - Crypto index funds

## If You Are a Crypto Beginner

### - TAKE PROPER PRECAUTIONS!

There are some precautions you should take if you are a crypto beginner playing with their life savings:
- Only give your money into things that you *understand*, and *believe in wholeheartedly*. 
  - **You can lose everything to sly crypto scammers if you act carelessly.**
- SEND TEST TRANSACTIONS BEFORE YOU SEND SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES.
  - A guide for your first crypto transfer is included below.

### - Action steps

Then do the following: 
- Subscribe to [Bankless](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bankless?app=desktop) on YouTube and self educate constantly. 
  - Video recommendations included below.
- Create an account with [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/) and buy Bitcoin and Ethereum. 
- Buy a [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x) hardware wallet to store yout Bitcoin.
- Create accounts with [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/) and [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) to use your Ethereum in open finance.
- Dollar cost average your crypto investments over a long period of time.

### - Psychological preparation

When I say the crypto markets are volatile, I mean they are *volatile*. Far more than you would have investing in the stock market through index funds.

:::caution Volatility

The only way to prepare for the volatility of the crypto markets is to tie yourself to the ship, and to vow to never sell out of fear.

:::

>**"I'm the worst investor of all time!"**

Also don't throw *everything* you have at crypto when you first get excited about it. Do it gradually, mentally psych yourself up for the rollercoaster of volatility and learn to embrace it. As long as you have a holding period of forever (you should) then the market volatility will be a little easier to swallow.

### - Take advantage of bonuses/promotions
