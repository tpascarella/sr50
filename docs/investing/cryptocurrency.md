## Importance of this Asset Class

Crypto is making a lot of headlines and for good reason. The technology is actively disrupting central and commercial banks, and empowers individuals regardless of citizenship.

However, the impressive returns have attracted a lot of *unsavory individuals* into the space. You need to do your homework in crypto, you can lose everything **if you act carelessly.**

:::tip 

As a general rule, it is wise to only put your money into something if you can also explain to a 5 year old. 

:::

:::info Fun fact

The term "sound money" is used to describe crypto. It comes from back in the day when everyone used gold coins, you would throw the coin against a table and the sound it made could distinguish real gold coins from gold plated lead coins.

### - Warren Buffett hates crypto (for now at least)

Esteemed investor Warren Buffett is skeptical of cryptocurrency, however he is looking at it through the lens of an *investor*, and I would argue that the opinions of engineers and economists would be more applicable here. Warren Buffet is neither. 

If George Hotz, Elon Musk and Milton Friedman are in favor, that is a strong enough case for me.

### - Nations die when their currency becomes worthless

![Zimbabwe Hyperinflation](/img/100-trillion.svg)

[In 1971, the government made the dollar worth as much as the "full faith and credit of the US Government."](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp) How much full faith and credit do you have in the US Government? Choose for yourself.

### "Is crypocurrency legitimate money?"

Crypto is the most complete money that has ever existed in human history.

Money needs to have a few characteristics to make it legitamate. These characteristics are:
- Durability
>Money needs to last for a long time. This is why animals or food can't be considered money because they die and rot over time.
- Portability
>It needs to be portable to actually trade hands.
- Divisibility
>You need to be able to divide it into smaller units.
- Uniformity
>Every $20 is the exact same as every other $20 bill. All cows are different from each other.
- Scarcity
>If supply increases and demand stays the same, value decreases. (This is why the value of fiat currencies have always trended towards zero, the cost of creating more is essentially zero.)
- Acceptability
>People need to be willing to take it in a trade.

All fiat currencies lack the scarcity component.

## Buy Bitcoin and Ethereum (to start)

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the 2 most important cryptocurrencies. Maximizing your crypto wealth means maximizing your Net Worth demoninated in these 2 assets.

### - "Is it too late to buy?"

No!

As investors, we are easily still in the "early market" portion of the technology adoption life cycle pictured below. There is still **tremendous upside** to investing in crypto. 

Of course, we are definitely paying higher prices than the early adopters, but we as investors have far more educational resources and social validation that the technology is legitimate.

### - Portfolio strategy

There is no "best" portfolio allocation. 

You cannot know what the best portfolio allocation will be unless you have a time machine and can look 10 years into the future. The best bet you have is to make informed decisions about which tokens you are going to invest in, and dollar cost average for a long enough holding period to make a profit.

### - Portfolio allocation

Start with 50% BTC & 50% ETH. Proceed then as you will.

### - Crypto index funds

If you subscribe to the investment strategy of indexing, buy one or a few of the indexes listed below:

## ***TAKE PROPER PRECAUTIONS***

There are some precautions you should take if you are a crypto beginner using their life savings:
- Only put your money into tokens that you **understand**, **believe in**, and have **actual real world utility**. 
- Send test transactions if you are a beginner using a hardware or software wallet.
- Beware the spam. Bots and theives are everywhere.
- Research & self educate consistently.

### - Project risk factors

Here are some risk factor questions for tokens you are thinking of putting money into:

- Does the token have a whitepaper? 
- Does the token have a proven track record?
- Does the token have a large liquidity pool?
- Does the token have distributed ownership?
- Does the token have actual utility?

At the very least you should have an answer to these questions before you put money into it.

### - Psychological preparation for the volatility

When I say the crypto markets are volatile, I mean they are *volatile*. Far more volatility than you will experience in the stock market through index funds.

:::caution Volatility

The only way to prepare for the volatility of the crypto markets is to experience it for yourself. 

Tie yourself to the ship, and to vow to **never sell at a position of weakness.**
