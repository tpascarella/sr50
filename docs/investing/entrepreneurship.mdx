# Entrepreneurship

## Advantages

- Offers a high ROI.

- Complete control over the assets you build.

## Disadvantages

- You likely won't see a return for a while.

- Much more difficult and time intensive.

## Resources

[Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) is the best resource I have found for learning how to start a startup. 
[Rework](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002MUAJ2A/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) is another great book I would recommend for small business owners.
