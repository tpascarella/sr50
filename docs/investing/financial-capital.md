# Financial Capital

>"You gotta spend money to make money." - Tom Bueller

## Importance

*Capital*, the term, is defined as the portion of financial resources you are able to invest. Different asset classes have different capital requirements in order to get started.

*Managing money* is only part of the equation, you need to *actually have money* to manage in order to make a massive impact.

## Comparing Asset Classes By Capital / Time / Effort Requirements

## Invest "F You Money", Not "Oh $hit Money"

A common pitfall I fell into as a young investor was to invest every dollar I had and left myself very little cash to protect myself. I was enticed by the dip price of crypto and went from 3 months of Runway down to 1.5 months. This was a mistake.

Do not put yourself in a position where you need to liquidate assets at a loss to cover your cash needs. Always have enough cash to secure yourself for a reasonable period of time and only invest what you have on top of that.

:::

Your "Oh $hit Money" serves a valuable purpose, it is insurance so you don't have to sell assets at a loss.

## Pinch Your Pennies

The only way to *acquire* capital is to either spend less or earn more. You save your pennies to **accumulate capital,** which you then use to invest towards solving the Financial Freedom Equation.

A consequence of having a single digit Savings Rate is that it takes a long time to build up a sufficient level of capital. Most life changing investments require significant capital!

## Plan For The Next Year of Cash Flows

If you have a salary and are confident in your paycheck size and consistency, predict and plan for how much after-tax capital will be disbursed to you. You can then use this number to estimate how much you can invest in the next year.

If you get paid monthly it will look like this:
- **12 Paychecks * Paycheck Amount** 

If you get paid every 2 weeks, count how many paychecks you will receive (some months you will get 3)
- **X# of Paychecks * Paycheck Amount**

If you do this, you can set aside appropriate percentages of capital towards different lifestyle and investing goals.

## Leverage

You can use other people's money to leverage your investments. While this is commonly used for Real Estate investing, you could use it for stock or crypto investments if you believe the cost will pay for itself.
