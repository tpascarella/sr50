## Pinch Pennies When You Have None

If you have no capital to invest, the only way to *get* capital to invest, is to *save* your pennies when you have none.

## Predict 1 Year of Cash Flows

If you have a *salary* and are reasonably confidend in your paycheck size and frequency, figure out how much you will get paid for the next year. 

If you get paid monthly it will look like this
>**12 Paychecks * Paycheck Amount**

If you get paid every 2 weeks, count how many paychecks you will receive (some months you will get 3)
>**# of Paychecks * Paycheck Amount**

That is your INFLOW of cash, and subtract the next years worth of OUTFLOWS to figure out how much more cash you should have at the end of the year.
