## Pinch Your Pennies

If you have zero capital to invest, the only way to *acquire* capital is to save your pennies as often as possible. You can do this by spending less, earning more or both.

## Plan For The Next Year of Cash Flows

If you have a salary and are confident in your paycheck size and consistency, predict and plan for how much after-tax capital will be disbursed to you. You can then use this number to estimate how much you can invest in the next year.

If you get paid monthly it will look like this:
- **12 Paychecks * Paycheck Amount** 

If you get paid every 2 weeks, count how many paychecks you will receive (some months you will get 3)
- **X# of Paychecks * Paycheck Amount**
