## Pinch Your Pennies

The only way to *acquire* capital is to either spend less or earn more. **You save your pennies to build up capital, which you then use to invest towards early financial freedom.** 

A consequence of a single digit Savings Rate is that it takes forever to build up a significant amount of capital. Any life changing investment will require capital to do it!

## Plan For The Next Year of Cash Flows

If you have a salary and are confident in your paycheck size and consistency, predict and plan for how much after-tax capital will be disbursed to you. You can then use this number to estimate how much you can invest in the next year.

If you get paid monthly it will look like this:
- **12 Paychecks * Paycheck Amount** 

If you get paid every 2 weeks, count how many paychecks you will receive (some months you will get 3)
- **X# of Paychecks * Paycheck Amount**
