# Franchises

Franchises are opportunities to purchase an existing business that you own and operate, while using an established businesses brand. Mostly retail and restaurants.

## Advantages

* Much less risk than starting a business from scratch.

* Predictable and consistent cash flow.

## Disadvantages

* It is a living and breathing business, meaning you or someone you hire will need to manage it with boots on the ground.

* Significantly more expensive to get started, sometimes you need a personal net worth in excess of a million dollars.

## Resources

[The Franchise Bible](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N95E8IW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) is currently the best book I have read on franchise investing. We are still in the process of finding the best web resource, and will add it once we do.
