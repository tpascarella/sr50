## Prerequisities

Investing in franchises requires significantly more capital than real estate. You will need at least $100,000 saved up in order to get financing for one of these, and usually more than $500,000.

### - Deciding which franchise you want

[This article from NerdWallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/best-franchises) states the 15 best franchise opportunities for 2022. Begin here if you don't already know which franchise you would like to invest in.

### - Don't just look at the numbers!

I would never open a Jimmy John's franchise, even if it pays well. Not all money is good money! Some of it is just blood money. You bought yourself a crappy job if you invest in one of those.

This is a marriage that you should be equally excited about 30 years from now as today. Don't let the cash flow numbers make the decision for you.

## Resources

[The Franchise Bible](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N95E8IW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) is the best book I have currently read on franchise investing.
