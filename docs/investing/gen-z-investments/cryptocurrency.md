## Importance of this Asset Class

Crypto is making a lot of headlines and for good reason. The technology is actively disrupting central and commercial banks, and empowers individuals regardless of citizenship.

However, the impressive returns have attracted a lot of *unsavory individuals* into the space. You need to do your homework in crypto, you can lose everything **if you act carelessly.**

:::tip 

As a general rule, it is wise to only put your money into something if you can also explain to a 5 year old. 

:::

:::info Fun fact

The term "sound money" is sometimes used to describe crypto, the term comes from a time when people used gold coins as payment. You would throw the coin against a table and use the sound it made to distinguish real gold coins from gold plated lead coins.

### - The FED is a Ponzi Scheme

[Watch this video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S-ZjGvOZ1A) and [read this book.](https://www.amazon.com/Creature-Jekyll-Island-Federal-Reserve/dp/091298645X)

>"The FED is the biggest ponzi scheme in the history of the world. If the American people truly knew how it really worked, they would be screaming for it to be abolished immediately." - Michael Snyder

### - Nations die when their currency becomes worthless

![Zimbabwe Hyperinflation](/img/zimbabwe-100-trillion-bill.svg)

[In 1971, the government made the dollar worth as much as the "full faith and credit of the US Government."](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp) How much full faith and credit do you have in the US Government? Choose for yourself.

40% of all the money that has ever been printed was printed last year. We are on an exponential trajectory to the US dollar going the way of the Zimbabwe dollar.

### - "Is crypocurrency legitimate money?"

Crypto is the most complete money that has ever existed in human history.

Money needs to have a few characteristics to make it legitamate. These characteristics are:
- Durability
>Money needs to last for a long time. This is why animals or food can't be considered money because they die and rot over time.
- Portability
>It needs to be portable to actually trade hands.
- Divisibility
>You need to be able to divide it into smaller units.
- Uniformity
>Every $20 is the exact same as every other $20 bill. All cows are different from each other.
- Scarcity
>If supply increases and demand stays the same, value decreases. (This is why the value of fiat currencies have always trended towards zero, the cost of creating more is essentially zero.)
- Acceptability
>People need to be willing to take it in a trade.

All fiat currencies lack the scarcity component.

### - Hard Money lowers time preference

People are much more willing to save and invest for the future if they are able to do so through a Hard Money.  Hard Money incentivizes saving for the future and sacrificing current consumption because you know your purchasing power will *increase* in the future if you sacrifice the present. This greatly reduces the willpower necessary to save.

## Buy Bitcoin and Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the 2 most important cryptocurrencies. Maximizing your crypto wealth means maximizing your Net Worth demoninated in these 2 assets.

- Bitcoin is a store of value with a fixed supply.
- Ethereum is the bedrock for the entire Defi ecosystem.

### - "Is it too late to buy?"

No!

As investors, we are easily still in the "early market" portion of the technology adoption life cycle pictured below. There is still **tremendous upside** to investing in crypto. 

Of course, we are definitely paying higher prices than the early adopters, but we as investors have far more educational resources and social validation that the technology is legitimate. 

![Technology adoption curve](/img/technology-adoption-curve.svg)

### - Portfolio strategy

There is no "best" portfolio allocation. 

You cannot know what the best portfolio allocation will be unless you have a time machine and can look 10 years into the future. The best bet you have is to make informed decisions about which tokens you are going to invest in, and dollar cost average for a long enough holding period to make a profit.

### - Portfolio allocation

Start with 50% BTC & 50% ETH. Proceed then as you will.

### - Consider a crypto IRA

These allow you to invest in crypto tax free! The same rules apply to crypto retirement accounts as typical retirement accounts, tax deferred is preferable.

You can sign up for one at [Alto IRA.](https://www.altoira.com/products/alto-cryptoira)

### - Crypto index funds

If you subscribe to the investment strategy of indexing, buy one or a few of the indexes listed below:

- [Bankless Bed Index (BED)](https://indexcoop.com/bankless-bed-index)
- [Data Economy Index (DATA)](https://indexcoop.com/data-economy-index)
- [DeFi Pulse Index (DPI)](https://indexcoop.com/defi-pulse-index-dpi)
- [Bankless DeFi Innovation Index (GMI)](https://indexcoop.com/bankless-defi-innovation-index-gmi)

## TAKE PROPER PRECAUTIONS {#precautions}

There are some precautions you should take if you are a crypto beginner using their life savings:
- Only put your money into tokens that you understand, believe in, and have **actual real world usage and utility**
- Use caution and send test transactions to a hardware or software wallet
- Beware the spam. Bots and scammers are *everywhere*
- Research & self educate consistently

### - Private keys

:::danger Never give these out!

Your private keys are the literal key to your digital empire. Guard them with your life!

:::

Store your private keys securely and completely offline. Options include [Stonebook notebooks](https://shieldfolio.com/products/shieldfolio-stonebook) or [steel capsules](https://shop.ledger.com/products/cryptosteel-capsule-solo), that should ideally be stored within fireproof bags, in multiple secure locations.

### - Individual project risk factors

Here are some risk factor considerations for tokens you are thinking of putting money into:

- Does the token have a whitepaper? 
- Does the token have a proven track record?
- Does the token have a large liquidity pool?
- Does the token have distributed ownership?
- Does the token have actual utility?

At the very least you should have an acceptable answer to these questions before you put any money into these projects.

### - Web tools you should bookmark

- [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)
- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

### - Action steps

Do the following: 
- Subscribe to the [Bankless](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bankless?app=desktop) YouTube channel and continually self educate
>Video recommendations included below
- Create an account with [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/) and buy Bitcoin and Ethereum
- Buy a [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x) hardware wallet to store Bitcoin
- Transfer your coins off of an exchange onto your hardware wallet
- Buy a faraday bag to keep your wallet secure from wireless attacks
- Create accounts with [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/) and [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) to use Ethereum in open finance
- Dollar cost average your crypto investments over a long period of time

### - Psychological preparation for the volatility

When I say the crypto markets are volatile, I mean they are *volatile*. Far more volatility than you will experience in the stock market through index funds.

:::caution Volatility

- The only way to prepare for the volatility of the crypto markets is to experience it for yourself. 
- Tie yourself to the ship and *never sell during a position of weakness.*

:::

This is why you can make a case that cryptocurrency is not for everyone. It takes a siginificant amount of will to bear the volatility of the markets head on.

### - Crypto bonuses
