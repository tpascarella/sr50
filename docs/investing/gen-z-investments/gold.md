## Buying Gold

If you will be buying gold bars/coins from a reputable online dealer, **look for the following characteristics**:
- Reviews from the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/), and/or [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/). 
>DO NOT ASSUME IF A WEBSITE HAS THE CORRESPONDING LOGOS THEY ARE LEGITIMATE REVIEWS. LOGOS CAN BE COPIED. CHECK THE SOURCE WEBSITES AND READ THE REVIEWS ON THERE.
- A buyback program. If the dealer is selling you a high quality gold bar, they will purchase it back from you.
- Buy bars produced from a recognized refinery, this makes liquidation much easier. A list of reputable refineries can be found below.

Talking publicly about gold ownership can make you a target for theft, assault or worse. It is dangerous to disclose this information carelessly.

## Storing Gold

[Here is a good article explaining different options to store your gold.](https://www.usmoneyreserve.com/blog/how-to-store-gold-silver/#:~:text=Rather%20than%20storing%20them%20in,be%20on%20the%20safe%20side.)

### - At home

Don't keep a lot of gold at home unless you are willing to invest in security. If you store gold at home, you should also invest in keeping guns at home.

### - In a vault

Once any other human being knows you own bullion, that is when you should look into off site storage.
