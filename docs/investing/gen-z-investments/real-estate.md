# Real Estate

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

>Acquiring/using land and buildings.

:::caution Denominated in fiat

Real Estate properties are only worth the discounted value of future cash flows, and since those cash flows are denominated in fiat money, the purchasing power of the cash flows, and subsequently the value of the business, will fall alongside it.

I only recommend certain specific real estate investments, such as House Hacking because of the impact it has on your Savings Rate, or the BRRRR method because it allows you to invest without losing capital, which can then be deployed towards assets that increase in purchasing power over time (such as crypto).

:::danger Disadvantages

- Significant capital requirements (in most cases).

## Prerequisites

### - Financial prerequisites

You will need at least 1 year of runway saved up before you should even consider investing in Real Estate. You will become responsible for operating and maintaining the building you buy, and this takes capital.

You will also need to build up a solid (700+) credit score. It is explained how to do this in the [credit scores section.](/credit/credit-scores.md)

### - Network

If possible, network with local investors and agents before you jump into real estate investing. There is a substantial learning curve with this asset class, and the more smart people you take advice from, the better off you will likely be.

### - Educational resources

[Biggerpockets.com](https://www.biggerpockets.com/) is the best resource I have found to become educated on Real Estate investing.

## Start by House Hacking

[House Hacking](/spending/housing.md) is a strategy that anyone interested in early financial freedom should consider, becauase it offers the swing in your Savings Rate without a significant downgrade in lifestyle.

## Graduate to BRRRR

BRRRR, the acronym stands for Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, and Repeat and was made popular by BiggerPockets. 

By refinancing at the end of the process, you can sometimes pull more money out of a deal than it took to make the deal happen. It allows you to *gain equity without losing capital* and is my preferred method of real estate investing as a result.

[David Greene's BRRRR book](https://www.amazon.com/Buy-Rehab-Rent-Refinance-Repeat/dp/B07S4LQWQ2) is a great resource to begin learning how to invest this way.
