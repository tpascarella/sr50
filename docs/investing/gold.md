## Buying Gold

If you will be buying gold bars/coins of gold from a reputable online dealer, there are some considerations you should make. **Look for the following**:
- Reviews from The Better Business Bureau, and Trustpilot. 
- DO NOT ASSUME IF A WEBSITE HAS THE LOGOS THEY ARE LEGITIMATE. LOGOS CAN BE COPIED. CHECK THE SOURCE WEBSITE AND READ THE REVIEWS ON THERE.
- Website buyback program. If they are selling you quality gold they will purchase it back from you.
- Buy from a recognized mint. (Makes liquidating that much easier)
