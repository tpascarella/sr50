## Buying Gold

If you will be buying gold bars/coins of gold from a reputable online dealer, there are some considerations you should make. **Look for the following**:
- Reviews from the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/), and/or [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/). 
- DO NOT ASSUME IF A WEBSITE HAS THE LOGOS THEY ARE LEGITIMATE. LOGOS CAN BE COPIED. CHECK THE SOURCE WEBSITE AND READ THE REVIEWS ON THERE.
- Website buyback program. If they are selling you quality gold they will purchase it back from you.
- Buy from a recognized mint. (Makes liquidating that much easier)

### The first rule of gold ownership

The first rule of gold ownership is that you don't talk about gold ownership. You especially do not admit this publicly unless necessary.

Don't talk about, don't become a target.
