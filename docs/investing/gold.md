## Buying Gold

If you will be buying gold bars/coins from a reputable online dealer, **look for the following**:
- Reviews from the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/), and/or [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/). 
>DO NOT ASSUME IF A WEBSITE HAS THE LOGOS THEY ARE LEGITIMATE, BECAUSE LOGOS CAN BE COPIED. CHECK THE SOURCE WEBSITE AND READ THE REVIEWS ON THERE.
- buyback program. If they are selling you high quality gold they will purchase it back from you.
- Buy bars from a recognized mint, this makes liquidation much easier.

### The first rule of gold ownership

The first rule of gold ownership is that **you do not talk about gold ownership.** 

:::danger

Talking publicly about gold ownership can make you a target for theft, assault or worse. It is dangerous to disclose this information carelessly.

## Storing Your Gold

[Here is a good article explaining different options to store gold and silver.](https://www.usmoneyreserve.com/blog/how-to-store-gold-silver/#:~:text=Rather%20than%20storing%20them%20in,be%20on%20the%20safe%20side.)

### - At home

Don't keep a lot of gold at home unless you are willing to invest in security. If you store gold at home, you should also store guns at home.

### - In a vault

Once any other human being knows you own bullion, that's when you should look into off site storage.
