## Buying Gold

If you will be buying gold bars/coins of gold from a reputable online dealer, there are some considerations you should make. **Look for the following**:
- Reviews from the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/), and/or [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/). 
  >DO NOT ASSUME IF A WEBSITE HAS THE LOGOS THEY ARE LEGITIMATE. LOGOS CAN BE COPIED. CHECK THE SOURCE WEBSITE AND READ THE REVIEWS ON THERE.
- Website buyback program. If they are selling you quality gold they will purchase it back from you.
- Buy from a recognized mint. (Makes liquidating that much easier)

### The first rule of gold ownership

The first rule of gold ownership is: **you do not talk about gold ownership.** 

You especially do not talk about gold ownership publicly.

:::danger

Talking publicly about gold ownership can make you a target for theft, assault, or worse. It is dangerous to disclose this information carelessly.

## Storing Your Gold

[Here is a good article for explaining different options to store your gold and silver.](https://www.usmoneyreserve.com/blog/how-to-store-gold-silver/#:~:text=Rather%20than%20storing%20them%20in,be%20on%20the%20safe%20side.)

### - At home

Don't keep a lot of gold at home unless you are willing to invest heavily in security.

### - In a vault

Once any human being other than yourself knows that you own gold bullion, that's when you should look into off site storage. A safe in your bedroom isn't secure enough.
