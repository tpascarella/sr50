## Buying Your First Gun

You want to buy a gun that you have experience shooting. Go to a range and test out different options and decide on one you like. That is *your gun* that you need to practice with and can rely on if your life is in danger.

## Proper Gun Storage

Buy a locked case for your gun and keep it out of the reach of children. Store your ammunition in a water resistent box.

## You Can Disclose That You Own Guns

Unlike gold or crypto, it is perfectly acceptable to let the world know you are armed to the teeth. It will deter thiefs and attackers.
