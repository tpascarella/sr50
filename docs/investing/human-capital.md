## Importance

Your Human Capital is the sum total of your knowledge, skills, and abilities you have to offer in a competitive job marketplace.

Investing in your Human Capital is one of the highest leverage investments you can possibly make, but since it doesn't pay immediate dividends like stocks, investing in human capital goes largely ignored.

### - Not the same as formal education!

When people think "I need more education" they immediately look at which degree they should apply for. The problem is that degrees are expensive and not always worth the cost (theater majors can tell you all about that).

A college degree is becoming more and more expensive at the exact same time as it's becoming less and less valuable. 

That is a dangerous trend to invest in.

### - Free education

You can learn anything on google. Everything.

[MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) is literally MIT posting their courses and materials online for free.

## Deep Work

Your ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task is what will separate you from the chaff of employees. It's like Starting Strength for your brain. If you cultivate your deep work ability, you are able to produce work at a much higher quality and quantity than others.

[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013UWFM52/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Cal Newport is required reading for everyone. 

[This article on doist.com](https://blog.doist.com/deep-work/) offers a great introduction to the concepts, as well as a cliffnotes version of the training regimen.
