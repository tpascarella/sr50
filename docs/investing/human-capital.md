# Human Capital

"I only invest in myself." - Elon Musk

## Advantages & Disadvantages

:::tip Advantages

- Unlimited ROI potential.
- Deeply gratifying expanding your skills.
- You will become far more valuable in our competitive world.

:::

:::danger Disadvantages

- Difficult to quantify.
- Does not pay immediate dividends.
- Requires a leap of faith.

:::

## Importance

Your Human Capital is the sum total of your knowledge, skills, and abilities you have to offer in a competitive job marketplace.

Investing in your Human Capital is one of the highest leverage investments you can possibly make, but since it doesn't pay immediate dividends like stocks, investing in human capital goes largely ignored.

### - Human capital is not the same as formal education!

When people think "I need to get more educated!" they immediately look at which degree to apply for. The problwm is that degrees are expensive and not always worth the cost (theater majors can tell you all about that)

:::danger

A college degree is becoming more and more expensive at the exact same time as it's becoming less and less valuable. 

That is a very dangerous trend to invest in.
