# Investing Overview

There are many different investment asset classes you can use to rapidly acquire financial freedom. They usually correlate between effort and return.

## [Entrepreneurship](entrepreneurship.md) (High Effort - High Potential Return)

Entrepreneurship is the process of creating a new business from scratch. This requires the most work but can reap the highest rewards.

## [Franchises](franchises.md) (High Effort - Medium/High Return)

Franchising is the process of purchasing an existing business for you to own and operate. This is less risky than entrepreneurship, but has higher upside. The cash flow is consistent, but requires a lot to get started, and also requires active management from you or someone you hire.

## [Real Estate](real-estate.md) (Medium/Low Effort - Medium/High Return)

Real Estate means buying land/buildings attached to it, to utilize for commercial purposes, usually renting out to tenants. There are creative ways to finance real estate purchases, meaning you can get started with as little as 3.5% down for a property. The cash flow is consistent and doesn't require much effort from you.

## [Stocks/Bonds](stocks-bonds.md) (No Effort - Low Return)

Stocks are ownership stakes in existing companies, and bonds are a fixed income isntrument with guaranteed repayment. You should only invest in these through index funds, which is explained in the stocks/bonds section. The return is not particularly high, and they don't offer much cash flow, but the investing requires zero time or effort from you. 

## [Human Capital](human-capital.md) (High Effort - High Return)

Your Human Capital is the sum total of all your knowledge, experience and abilities you have to offer in a competitive job market. This is the highest leverage investment you can make.
