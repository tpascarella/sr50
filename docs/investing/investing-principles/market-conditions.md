## Market Agnostic Advice

The best thing you can do, during either a Bull or Bear market, is to maintain a strong Savings Rate, a strong cash position, and dollar cost average to accumulate shares. 

The worst thing you can do is liquidate at a position of weakness. Never be forced to sell your assets from a position of weakness!
