# Investing Strategy

Develop & refine a strategy you'll use for decades.

## The Best Investing Strategy

The best investing strategy is **the continual and unrelenting accumulation of Real Assets.**

## Make Bets That Align With The Future

Invest in things that will still be relevent in the next 100 years (estimating to the best of your abilities). Live in the future and invest in what aligns with that.

>Often times this means not chasing what worked for your grandparents. That world is long behind us.

## Stay Invested

[This graphic from Putnam Investments](https://www.putnam.com/literature/pdf/II508-ec7166a52bb89b4621f3d2525199b64b.pdf) shows the consequence of missing the best days of stock market returns. 

It is impossible to predict what the best days of the market will be, and if you are not invested in an attempt to "time the market" there is a near certain chance you will miss.

## Diversify

Diversity across as many asset classes as you are willing to. They each have advantages and disadvantages that will be useful in a variety of circumstances.

Strive to own:
- [Crypto assets](cryptocurrency.md)
- Fiat assets:
  - [Stocks/bonds](stocks-bonds.md)
  - [Franchise businesses](franchises.md)
  - [Equity in your own startup](entrepreneurship.md)
- [Land/property](real-estate.md)
- [Gold and other precious metals](gold.md)
- [Guns and ammunition](guns.md)

## Operate Silently

Openly talking about your assets or flaunting your money can make you a target for assault, robbery, or worse. You don't know what that person is capable of, or who they might tell.
