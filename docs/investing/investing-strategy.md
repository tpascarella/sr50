# Investing Strategy

>Develop & refine a strategy you'll use for decades.

## The Best Investing Strategy

The best investing strategy is **the continual and unrelenting accumulation of Assets.**

### - Make bets that align with the future

Invest in things that will still be valuable in the next 100 years (estimating to the best of your ability). Often times this means not chasing what worked for your grandparents. That world is long behind us.

## Time in the Market vs. Timing the Market

[This graphic from Putnam Investments](https://www.putnam.com/literature/pdf/II508-ec7166a52bb89b4621f3d2525199b64b.pdf) shows the consequence of missing a handful of the best days of stock market returns. 

It is impossible to predict *when* the best days of the market will occur, and if you are not invested due to an attempt to *"time the market"* there is a very high probability you will miss out entirely and your cumulative returns will be significantly lower.

### - It isn't worth the time

Through investing in index funds, you can reasonably expect an 8% annual return if you do nothing but buy and hold the index, it requires zero effort. And [even though it has been definitely shown that hardly anyone can outperform the market](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/beating-the-market.asp), many people still try. 

They pretend to be Warren Buffett, reading quarterly reports and timing trades perfectly to get the maximum return they can. However, even if they do manage to beat the index (astronomically rare on it's own), there are a few more considerations:
- how much time did it take you to get that return? 
- what else could you have done with that time? 
- how big an impact did that boost in return have to your overall financial picture?

:::caution It pays less than minimum wage

If you beat the market by 1%, but you only have $1000 total invested in stocks, that 1% boost amounts to an extra $10 per year. 

Divide that $10 by how many hours it took you to get that return, and you will quickly realize that all of that effort pays less than a minimum wage job. You are **literally better off just working more hours and investing the difference.**

## Diversify

Diversify across as many asset classes as you can. They each have advantages and disadvantages that will be useful in a variety of circumstances.

You want to own a variety of:
- [Crypto assets](cryptocurrency.md)
- Fiat assets:
  - [Stocks/bonds](stocks-bonds.md)
  - [Franchise businesses](franchises.md)
  - [Equity in your own startup](entrepreneurship.md)
- [Land/property](real-estate.md)
- [Gold and other precious metals](gold.md)
- [Guns and ammunition](guns.md)

## Do Not Draw Attention to Yourself

Openly talking about your assets or flaunting your money can make you a target for assault, robbery, or a gold digging spouse. 

:::danger Don't become a target

Do not carelessly disclose how much you are worth. You don't know what that person is capable of, how desperate they may be for cash, or who they might tell.
