# Philosophy

The best investing strategy is **the continual and unrelenting accumulation of Assets.**

## Make Bets That Align With The Future

Invest in things that will still be relevent in the next 100 years (estimating to the best of your abilities). Live in the future and invest in what aligns with that.

>Often times this means not chasing what worked for your grandparents. That world is long behind us.

## Diversify

Diversity across as many asset classes as you are willing to. They each have advantages and disadvantages that will be useful in a variety of circumstances.

Strive to own:
- Crypto assets
- Fiat assets
- Land/property
- Metals
- Guns
