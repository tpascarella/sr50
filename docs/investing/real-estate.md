## Opportunity

Real Estate investing is the process of acquiring land and buildings that will provide economic value, usually by renting out to individual renters or businesses.

## Prerequisites

If possible, network with local investors and agents before you jump into real estate investing. There is a substantial learning curve with this asset class, and the more smart people you take advice from, the better off you will likely be.

### - Financial prerequisites

You will need at least 1 year of runway saved up before you should even consider investing in Real Estate. You will become responsible for operating and maintaining the building you buy, and this takes capital.

You will also need to build up a solid (700+) credit score. It is explained how to do this in the [credit scores section.](/credit/credit-scores.md)

## Resources To Get Educated

[Biggerpockets.com](https://www.biggerpockets.com/) is the best resource I have found to become educated on Real Estate investing.

## Start With House Hacking

[House Hacking](/spending/housing.md) is a strategy that anyone interested in early financial freedom should consider, becauase it offers the swing in your Savings Rate without a significant downgrade in lifestyle.

## Graduate to BRRRR

BRRRR, the acronym stands for Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, and Repeat and was made popular by BiggerPockets. 

By refinancing at the end of the process, you can sometimes pull more money out of a deal than it took to make the deal happen. It allows you to *gain equity without losing capital* and is my preferred method of real estate investing as a result.

[David Greene's BRRRR book](https://www.amazon.com/Buy-Rehab-Rent-Refinance-Repeat/dp/B07S4LQWQ2) is a great resource to begin learning how to invest this way.
