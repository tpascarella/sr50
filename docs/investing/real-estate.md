## Opportunity

Real Estate investing is the process of acquiring land and buildings that will provide economic value, usually by renting out to individual renters or businesses.

## Prerequisites

If possible, network with local investors and agents before you jump into real estate investing. There is a substantial learning curve with this asset class, and the more smart people you take advice from, the better off you will likely be.

### - Financial prerequisites

You will need at least 1 year of runway saved up before you should even consider investing in Real Estate. You will become responsible for operating and maintaining the building you buy, and this takes capital.

You will also need to build up a solid (700+) credit score. It is explained how to do this in the [credit scores section.](/credit/credit-scores.md)
