# Real Estate

Real Estate investing is the process of acquiring land and buildings that will provide economic value, usually by renting out to individual renters or businesses.

## Advantages

* Does not require much time from you to manage, you can manage an entire portfolio for just a couple of hours per month.

* Provide consistent cash flow, assuming you invest in stable properties.

* Disproportionate knowledge or effort results in disproportionately higher returns.

## Disadvantages

* Requires significant capital to get into the game. You will need to provide at least a 3.5% down payment for an FHA property, and will need to keep additional capital for repairs or vacancies.

* While you can get higher returns for higher effort, the market still places a hard ceiling on what you can charge for rent. 

* You get what you pay for, cheap real estate gets you bad tenants.

## Prerequisites

You will need at least 1 year of personal runway saved up before you should consider investing in Real Estate. You will also need to build up a solid (700+) credit score.
