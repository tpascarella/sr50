## Why Vanguard?

## Index Funds vs. ETFs

I am not going to tell you what stocks to invest in. I’ll let someone more experienced do it for me. 

Warren Buffett, if you are unfamiliar, is unanimously regarded as the greatest investor the world has ever seen. He is currently the 7th wealthiest person on Earth, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, (who own Geico, Duracell and Dairy Queen outright, along with considerable ownership stakes in Kraft, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Coca Cola and Apple) and cofounder of the Giving Pledge with Bill Gates, where billionaires pledge to give at least half of their fortune away to charity. That is one impressive resume. What does he recommend you invest in? Low-cost index funds.

An index fund is a fund that invests in a group of stocks according to a specific index. I assume you’ve heard of the S&P 500, right? The S&P 500 is an index that tracks the 500 largest publicly traded companies in America, that’s it. So, if you invest in an S&P 500 index fund, you are investing in those same 500 companies, in the same proportions, as the index. Index funds are the simplest, most powerful, most tax efficient, lowest time requirement investments you can ever make in this asset class. 

Index and mutual funds are considered “low cost” if their expense ratio is less than one tenth of a percent. Most index funds have expense ratios less than five hundredths of a percent. Index funds are known as passive funds because all they do is follow what the index does, as opposed to actively managed funds, which have full time management and can have expense ratios in excess of 1%.

A 1% expense ratio doesn’t sound too bad, but when compounded over decades it’s a real drag on your investment performance. Not to mention the mountain of data making it abundantly clear that basically no one can outperform the index over time, even the Ivy League MBAs who do this 24/7. There are many reasons for this:
plain human error, 
irrational and impulsive decisions from a seemingly infinite number of investors, 
an ever changing competitive landscape for the companies within the index,

Just to name a few, but the two biggest reasons are that: 
any time stocks are bought and sold within the fund, that triggers a taxable event, which increases operating costs, 
the “professionals'' who manage the fund have hefty salaries and bonuses that need to be paid as well as other operating costs like marketing, offices, etc. That money has to come from somewhere! (You.)
So, active fund managers not only have to outperform the index over time (astonishingly rare on its own), but outperform the index with a big enough margin to cover the greatly inflated management costs. So do yourself a favor and just stick with index funds. Your great grandkids will thank you.

You will reach FI once you have 25X your yearly expenses invested in a 50/50 stock/bond fund split. This 25X number is based on the famous Trinity Study, which analyzed 100+ years of market performance and retirement withdrawals. They concluded that if you withdraw 4% of your portfolio in your first year to live on, and adjust for inflation the following years, you have a near certain probability of never outliving your money in a traditional 30 year retirement. This eventually became known as the 4% rule. The only exception would be if the day before you retire, the stock market crashes and your investment balance gets cut in half as soon as you pull the money out. The 4% rule is a rule of thumb and shouldn’t be taken as the end all be all of retirement plans, (especially for FI people), but it’s a good number to start with. You can, and probably will keep working past this point. 

just to name a few, and your 401K likely invests in funds from these companies. I will always recommend Vanguard if you have the choice, the legal ownership structure of Vanguard being the reason why.

Vanguard is owned by the funds that make up Vanguard, and those funds are owned by the investors of those funds. Meaning you, as an investor of Vanguard, are also a partial owner of Vanguard. This is in sharp contrast to every other mutual fund company in the world, who are owned by shareholders who expect to be paid out of profits from their funds. As a result, they often have much higher expense ratios for their mutual funds and that money will come out of your retirement savings. Vanguard doesn’t, because the owner is you.
Investors are very quickly catching on to this fact, too. Check out this excerpt from the New York Times:

“In the last three calendar years, investors sank $823 billion into Vanguard funds, the company says. The scale of that inflow becomes clear when it is compared with the rest of the mutual fund industry — more than 4,000 firms in total. All of them combined took in just a net $97 billion during that period, Morningstar data shows. Vanguard, in other words, scooped up about 8.5 times as much money as all of its competitors.”

To satisfy the 4% rule, you will need one stock index fund and one bond index fund to invest in. If you are currently working and have a stable paycheck, I recommend investing as aggressively as you can and go 100% in US stocks. Once you’ve crossed the threshold of FI and are living off your portfolio, then I recommend a 75-25 stock/bond split in either direction depending on your risk tolerance to best preserve your wealth. The recommended Vanguard funds are VTSAX for stocks, and VBTLX for bonds.
