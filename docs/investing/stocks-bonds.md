# Stocks & Bonds

## Advantages & Disadvantages

:::tip Advantages

- Completely hands off.
- Excellent diversification.
- Tax efficient.

:::

:::danger Disadvantages

- Low return. (around 8% per year)
- No unfair advantage.
- Requires at least 25X yearly expenses to reach FI.

:::

## The 4% Rule

You will reach FI once you accumulate 25X your yearly expenses invested in a 50/50 stock/bond fund split. 

:::note

This 25X number is based on the famous Trinity Study, which analyzed 100+ years of market performance and retirement withdrawals. They concluded that if you withdraw 4% of your portfolio in your first year to live on, and adjust for inflation the following years, you have a near certain probability of never outliving your money in a traditional 30 year retirement. This eventually became known as the 4% rule. 
>The only exception would be if on the day before you retire, the stock market crashes and your investment portfolio gets cut in half right before you pull the money out. 

:::

The 4% rule is a *rule of thumb* and shouldn’t be taken as the end all be all of retirement plans, (especially for FI people), but it’s a good number to start with. You can, and probably will keep working past this point. 

### Portfolio allocation for the 4% rule

To satisfy the 4% rule, you will need one stock index fund and one bond index fund to invest in. 

If you are currently working and have a stable paycheck, I recommend investing as aggressively as you can and go 100% in US stocks. 

Once you’ve crossed the threshold of FI and are living off your portfolio, then I recommend a 75-25 stock/bond split in either direction depending on your risk tolerance to best preserve your wealth. 

:::note 

The recommended Vanguard funds are VTSAX for stocks, and VBTLX for bonds.

## Index Funds

:::info A Quote From Warren Buffett

"A low-cost index fund is the most sensible equity investment for the great majority of investors. By periodically investing in an index fund, the know-nothing investor can actually outperform most investment professionals." 
:::

An index fund is a mutual fund that invests in a group of stocks according to a specific index. 

>I assume you’ve heard of the S&P 500, right? The S&P 500 is an index that tracks the 500 largest publicly traded companies in America, that’s it. So, if you invest in an S&P 500 index fund, you are investing in those same 500 companies, in the same proportions, as the S&P 500. 

Index funds are the simplest, most powerful, most tax efficient, lowest time requirement investments you can ever make in this asset class. 

### Expense ratios

Index and mutual funds are considered “low cost” if their expense ratio is less than one tenth of a percent. Most index funds have expense ratios less than five hundredths of a percent. 

Index funds are considered *passively managed funds* because all they do is follow what the index does, as opposed to *actively managed funds*, which require full time management and can have expense ratios in excess of 1%.

:::caution 

A 1% expense ratio doesn’t sound too bad, but when compounded over decades it’s a real drag on your investment performance. Not to mention the mountain of data making it abundantly clear that basically no one can outperform the index over time.

:::

So look at the expense ratio of any fund you are planning on putting money into. If it is more than 1/10th of a percent (.1%), pick another fund.

### Why are index funds so much cheaper than mutual funds?

A few reasons:
- any time stocks are bought and sold within the fund, that triggers a taxable event, which increases operating costs, 
- the “professionals'' who manage the fund have hefty salaries and bonuses that need to be paid 
- other operating costs like marketing, offices, etc. 

That money has to come from somewhere! (You)

Active fund managers not only have to outperform the index over time (astonishingly rare on its own), but they have to outperform the index with a big enough margin to cover the greatly inflated management costs. 

:::tip 

So do yourself a favor and just stick with index funds. Your great grandkids will thank you.

## Index Funds vs. ETFs

There is barely any difference between Index Funds and ETFs. They are slightly different packaging for the same underlying investment product. (Kind of like different wrapping papers for the same underlying Christmas present)

That being said, I do recommend you go with index funds over ETFs if you have the choice, simply because the fact that index funds close at the end of each trading day, instead of updating continuously over the course of the day like stocks. 

This gives you ever so slightly more friction against making an impulse sell, and I think that is worth the extra basis point in cost.

You can also buy index funds in fractional amounts, whereas with ETFs you need to buy shares at their market price. 

>For example, if an ETF share is $140, but you had $1500 to invest, you could only buy $1400 worth ($140x10 shares) instead of $1500 in fractional shares using the index fund. 

## Portfolio Allocation Recommendations

### JL Collins

JL Collins in the book, A Simple Path to Wealth recommends a portfolio allocation of the following:

- 100% Stocks while you are in the Wealth Building Phase (Stage 3 and below)
- 75% Stocks / 25% Bonds while you are in the Wealth Preservation Phase (Stage 4 and higher)

### Benjamin Graham

Benjamin Graham, author of The Intelligent Investor, recommends a portfolio allocation of the following:

- 50/50 split between Stocks/Bonds, while going no further that 75/25 in either direction.

## Best Vanguard Funds

- [VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax) (stock index fund)
- [VBTLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VBTLX) (bond index fund)
- [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTI) (stock ETF)
- [BND](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BND) (bond ETF)

### Why Vanguard?

Vanguard is the best option in the mutual fund industry because of their ownership structure. 

Vanguard is owned by the funds that make up Vanguard. And those funds are owned by the investors of those funds. Meaning you, as an *investor of Vanguard*, are also a *partial owner* of Vanguard. 

This is in sharp contrast to the rest of the mutual fund industry, which are owned by shareholders who expect to be paid out of the profits of their funds. 

Investors have caught onto this fact too. Here is a [New York Times excerpt](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/business/mutfund/vanguard-mutual-index-funds-growth.html) from 2017:

>“In the last three calendar years, investors sank $823 billion into Vanguard funds, the company says. The scale of that inflow becomes clear when it is compared with the rest of the mutual fund industry — more than 4,000 firms in total. All of them combined took in just a net $97 billion during that period, Morningstar data shows. Vanguard, in other words, scooped up about 8.5 times as much money as all of its competitors.”

So stick with Vanguard if you have the choice. They have some of the lowest expense ratios in the industry, and their core values are aligned with your best interests. 

I wouldn't give my money to any other company.

## Optimizing Returns With Tax Advantaged Accounts

To squeeze the highest possible return out of your portfolio, max out your accounts in this order; (all from Vanguard)
- HSA (Health Savings Account) 
- Traditional IRA
- 401K
- Roth IRA
- Taxable brokerage account.

As a general rule you want to invest *pre-tax* dollars in these funds, because you will never get another chance to optimize *this year's* taxes, and there are strategies you can use to pull the money out tax free later.

[This article from the Mad Fientist](https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/) explains how to optimize taxes with these types of accounts
