# Stocks/Bonds

## Advantages

* Completely hands off, index fund investing requires zero time or effort from you.

* Great diversification, in one index fund you can invest in thousands of companies.

## Disadvantages

* The return you get does not correlate with effort, it is simply what the market returns. Stock market returns average to about 8% per year.

* Because the return is not very high, it can take more time to reach FI in this asset class than Real Estate or Entrepreneurship.

## The 4% Rule

You will reach FI once you have 25X your yearly expenses invested in a 50/50 stock/bond fund split. This 25X number is based on the famous Trinity Study, which analyzed 100+ years of market performance and retirement withdrawals. They concluded that if you withdraw 4% of your portfolio in your first year to live on, and adjust for inflation the following years, you have a near certain probability of never outliving your money in a traditional 30 year retirement. This eventually became known as the 4% rule. The only exception would be if the day before you retire, the stock market crashes and your investment balance gets cut in half as soon as you pull the money out. The 4% rule is a rule of thumb and shouldn’t be taken as the end all be all of retirement plans, (especially for FI people), but it’s a good number to start with. You can, and probably will keep working past this point. 

To satisfy the 4% rule, you will need one stock index fund and one bond index fund to invest in. If you are currently working and have a stable paycheck, I recommend investing as aggressively as you can and go 100% in US stocks. Once you’ve crossed the threshold of FI and are living off your portfolio, then I recommend a 75-25 stock/bond split in either direction depending on your risk tolerance to best preserve your wealth. The recommended Vanguard funds are VTSAX for stocks, and VBTLX for bonds.

## Index Funds

>"A low-cost index fund is the most sensible equity investment for the great majority of investors. By periodically investing in an index fund, the know-nothing investor can actually outperform most investment professionals." -Warren Buffett

An index fund is a fund that invests in a group of stocks according to a specific index. I assume you’ve heard of the S&P 500, right? The S&P 500 is an index that tracks the 500 largest publicly traded companies in America, that’s it. So, if you invest in an S&P 500 index fund, you are investing in those same 500 companies, in the same proportions, as the index. Index funds are the simplest, most powerful, most tax efficient, lowest time requirement investments you can ever make in this asset class. 

Index and mutual funds are considered “low cost” if their expense ratio is less than one tenth of a percent. Most index funds have expense ratios less than five hundredths of a percent. Index funds are known as passive funds because all they do is follow what the index does, as opposed to actively managed funds, which have full time management and can have expense ratios in excess of 1%.

### Expense Ratios

A 1% expense ratio doesn’t sound too bad, but when compounded over decades it’s a real drag on your investment performance. Not to mention the mountain of data making it abundantly clear that basically no one can outperform the index over time, even the Ivy League MBAs who do this 24/7. There are many reasons for this:
plain human error, 
irrational and impulsive decisions from a seemingly infinite number of investors, 
an ever changing competitive landscape for the companies within the index,

Just to name a few, but the two biggest reasons are that: 
any time stocks are bought and sold within the fund, that triggers a taxable event, which increases operating costs, 
the “professionals'' who manage the fund have hefty salaries and bonuses that need to be paid as well as other operating costs like marketing, offices, etc. That money has to come from somewhere! (You.)

So, active fund managers not only have to outperform the index over time (astonishingly rare on its own), but outperform the index with a big enough margin to cover the greatly inflated management costs. So do yourself a favor and just stick with index funds. Your great grandkids will thank you.

## Portfolio Allocation

### JL Collins

JL Collins in the book, A Simple Path to Wealth recommends a portfolio allocation of the following:

- 100% Stocks while you are in the Wealth Building Phase

- 75% Stocks / 25% Bonds while you are in the Wealth Preservation Phase

### Benjamin Graham

Benjamin Graham from The Intelligent Investor recommends a portfolio allocation of the following:

- 50/50 split between Stocks/Bonds, while going no further that 75/25 in either direction according to market conditions.

## Best Vanguard Funds

- [VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax) (stock index fund)
- [VBTLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VBTLX) (bond index fund)
- [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTI) (stock ETF)
- [BND](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BND) (bond ETF)

## Why Vanguard?

Vanguard is owned by the funds that make up Vanguard. And those funds are owned by the investors of those funds. 

Meaning you, as an investor of Vanguard, are also a *partial owner* of Vanguard. 

This is in sharp contrast to the rest of the mutual fund industry, which have shareholders as owners who expect to be paid out of the profits of their funds. Investors have caught onto this fact too. Check out this excerpt from 2017:

>“In the last three calendar years, investors sank $823 billion into Vanguard funds, the company says. The scale of that inflow becomes clear when it is compared with the rest of the mutual fund industry — more than 4,000 firms in total. All of them combined took in just a net $97 billion during that period, Morningstar data shows. Vanguard, in other words, scooped up about 8.5 times as much money as all of its competitors.”

So stick with Vanguard if you have the choice. They have some of, if not the, lowest expense ratios in the industry, and their core values are aligned with your best interests. I wouldn't give my money to any other company.

## Index Funds vs. ETFs

There is hardly any difference between Index Funds and ETFs. They are slightly different packaging for the same underlying investment product. Kind of like different wrapping papers for the same Christmas present.

I recommend you go with the index fund over ETFs if you have the choice, simply because the fact that they close at the end of each trading day, instead of continuously over the course of the day, gives you slightly more friction against making an impulse sell. 

## Optimizing Returns

To squeeze the highest possible return out of your portfolio, max out your accounts in this order; (all from Vanguard)
- HSA (Health Savings Account) 
- Traditional IRA
- 401K
- Roth IRA
- Taxable brokerage account.
