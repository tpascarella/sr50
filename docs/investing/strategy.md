# Strategy

The best investing strategy is **the continual and unrelenting accumulation of Assets.**

:::tip 

While spending as little as possible on your lifestyle and taxes, too.

:::

## Align With The Future

Invest in things that will still be relevent in the next 100 years (estimating to the best of your abilities). Live in the future and invest in what aligns with that.

>Often times this means not chasing what worked for your grandparents. That world is long behind us.

## Planting Seeds

Everything you invest in should have a holding period of forever. These seeds you are planting will grow into massive orchards down the line and will pay dividends to you until the end of civilization.

## Diversify

Diversity across as many asset classes as you are willing to. They each have advantages and disadvantages that will be useful in a variety of circumstances.

Buy crypto, gold, guns, and real estate.

### Plan for WW3

It's easy to forget that the comforts of modernity are really strange when you look at the world historically. Our ancestors dealt with war, plague, famine, and the elements repeatedly.

Don't only invest in things that only work in peacetime. Guns, ammo and gold are all equally valid investments if an EMP bomb is dropped on us.
