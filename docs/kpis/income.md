# Income

## Importance

Income is the 4th most important KPI in personal finance, and a lot of people mistake it as being the most important.

:::caution 

A higher income is potentially better for reaching FI, IF AND ONLY IF it is accompanied by a correspondingly higher Savings Rate.

## Pitfalls of a High Income

There are also many common pitfalls that come with having a high income, such as:

### - Increased stress from jobs that pay that much

A lot of jobs that pay high salaries are very stressful and require working lots of hours, which defeats our purpose of not having to trade time for money.

### - You can dig a much bigger hole

It is significantly easier to bury yourself into a financial hole making six figures than minimum wage. All of a sudden, credit card companies are offering you financing options left and right, which requires higher willpower to resist.

### - Societal pressures

As you make more money, societal pressure is higher to flaunt that wealth through expensive houses, cars and tech gadgets. If you're a Neurosurgeon, you can't expect to drive a 10 year old Honda, right?

It is significantly easier to bury yourself into a financial hole with a high salary than a low salary.

## Lifestyle Creep

Lifestyle creep is the term for elevating your lifestyle up to your current level of income, and is the reason six-figure earners have just as low of Savings Rates as people making modest incomes. If you increase your lifestyle because you are making more money, you completely eliminate the financial benefit of making more money!

Nicer apartment, better car, and fancy meals out. The Big 3 expense categories often scale with your income, and is what keeps high income earners poor as well.
