# Income

## Income Doesn't Matter at All

Savings Rate takes absolute priority over Income.

A Savings Rate of 15% works *exactly as well* at $30,000/yr as $300,000/yr. The income makes absolutely no difference.

A higher income is *potentially* better, only if it is accompanied by a *correspondingly higher Savings Rate*, if it is not, a higher income can actually hurt you more than it can help you.

## Pitfalls

A lot of jobs that pay high salaries are very stressful, and require lots of hours, which defeats our purpose of getting control of our time as fast as possible.

It is also much easier to bury yourself into a deep financial hole making six figures than minimum wage. All of a sudden, credit card companies are offering you financing options left and right.
