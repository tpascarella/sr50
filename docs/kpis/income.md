# Income

## Not as Important as You Think

A higher income is *potentially* better for reaching FI only if it is accompanied by a *correspondingly higher Savings Rate*.

## Pitfalls of a High Income

### Stress

A lot of jobs that pay high salaries are very stressful and require working lots of hours, which defeats our purpose of not having to trade time for money.

### You Can Dig a Much Bigger Hole

It is also much easier to bury yourself into a deep financial hole making six figures than minimum wage. All of a sudden, credit card companies are offering you financing options left and right, which requires higher willpower to avoid.

### Societal Pressures

As you make more money, societal pressure is higher to flaunt that wealth through expensive houses, cars and tech gadgets. Neurosurgeons can't be expected to drive a 10 year old Honda, right?

It is significantly easier to bury yourself into a financial hole with a high salary than a low salary.

Do not fall victim to lifestyle creep!
