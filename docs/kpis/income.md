# Income

## Income is Much Less Important Than You Think

Savings Rate takes absolute priority over Income.

A Savings Rate of 15% works *exactly as well* at $30,000/yr as $300,000/yr. The income makes absolutely no difference.

A higher income is *potentially* better, only if it is accompanied by a *correspondingly higher Savings Rate*, if it is not, a higher income can actually hurt you more than it can help you.

## Pitfalls of a High Income

### Stress

A lot of jobs that pay high salaries are very stressful, and require lots of hours, which defeats our purpose of getting control of our time as fast as possible.

### It Becomes Much Easier to Bury Yourself

It is also much easier to bury yourself into a deep financial hole making six figures than minimum wage. All of a sudden, credit card companies are offering you financing options left and right.

### Societal Pressures

You can't expect a neurosurgeon to drive a 10 year old Honda Civic, do you? Rich people hang out with other rich people, and rich people have expensive lifestyles. 

You get lumped in with people who live lavish lives and have the latest and greatest everything. If you want to fit in you need to live an expensive lifestyle as well.
