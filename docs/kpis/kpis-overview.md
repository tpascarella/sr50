# KPIs Overview

KPI is an acronym for Key Performance Indicator. As with any objective there are metrics that you use to determine how well you are doing, and for our purposes there are 4 you need to understand.

## [Savings Rate](savings-rate.md) (HIGH IMPACT)

Savings Rate is the most imprtant KPI in Personal Finance.

Savings Rate measures how much of your after-tax take home pay you are utilizing to reach Financial Independence. Obviously, using 80% of your paycheck to reach FI will get you there much faster than only using 15%. The best part is that this happens *regardless* of Income and Net Worth. Meaning an 80% Savings Rate works just as well for someone with a $30,000 salary, as it does for someone with a $300,000 salary. It does not matter at all how much you make, it only matters how much you keep!

Essentially, how fast you are moving forward.

## [Runway](runway.md) (HIGH IMPACT)

Runway is the second most important KPI in Personal Finance.

Runway measures how many months of liquidity you have. Meaning if you lost your job tomorrow and had to live off reserves, how many months would you be able to last? This is a very important number to have in your back pocket.

Essentially, how secure you are right now.

## [Net Worth](net-worth.md) (LOW IMPACT)

Net Worth is a *very distant third* KPI.

Net Worth is an accounting formula that tells you the total value of your assets minus liabilities. However, assets can vary widely in usefulness, and it reveals nothing about your cash flow situation. 

You can have a million dollar Net Worth, but if it is composed of home equity and retirement accounts you don't have access to, it really doesn't benefit you that much.

:::note

Net Worth is useful for revealing any blind spots left behind by Savings Rate and Runway, but is an order of magnitude less important than the previous two.

## [Income](income.md) (LOW IMPACT)

Income is only imporant in what impact it has on your Savings Rate. If you have a 6-figure income, but a single digit Savings Rate, your income does not benefit you *at all*. Savings Rate is EVERYTHING.
