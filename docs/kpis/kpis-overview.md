# KPIs Overview

As with any objective, there are  metrics that you use to determine how well you are doing, personal finance is no different.

## Savings Rate (High impact)

[Savings Rate](savings-rate.md) is the most imprtant KPI in Personal Finance.

Savings Rate measures how much of your after-tax take home pay you are utilizing to reach Financial Independence. Obviously, using 80% of your paycheck to reach FI will get you there much faster than 15%. The best part is that this happens *irrespective* of Income and Net Worth. Meaning an 80% Savings Rate works just as well for the person at a $30,000 salary with 6 figures in student loans, as it does for someone with a $300,000 salary who is completely debt free. 

Essentially, *how fast you are moving forward*.

## Runway (High impact)

[Runway](runway.md) is the second most important KPI in Personal Finance.

Runway measures how many months of liquidity you have, if all of your cash flow was taken away. Meaning, if you lost your job tomorrow and had to live off reserves, how many months would you be able to last? This is a very important number to know.

Essentially, *how secure you are right now*.

## Net Worth (Low impact)

[Net Worth](net-worth.md) is a *very distant third* KPI.

Net Worth is the accounting formula that tells you the total value of your assets and liabilities. However, assets can vary widely in usefulness, and it reveals nothing about your cash flow situation. You can have a million dollar Net Worth, but if it is composed of home equity and retirement accounts you don't have access to, it really doesn't benefit you that much.

This is only useful in revealing any blind spots left behind by Savings Rate and Runway, and is an order of magnitude less important than the previous two.

## Income (Low impact)

[Income](incomd.md) is only imporant in what impact it has on your Savings Rate. I'm going to repeat that. 

>*Income is only important, in regards to what impact it has on your Savings Rate.* 

If you have a 6-figure income, but a single digit Savings Rate, your income does not benefit you *at all*.
