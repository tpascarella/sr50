# Net Worth

A very distant 3rd KPI.

## Importance

Net Worth is an order of magnitude less important than both Savings Rate and Runway.

### - Considerations

- Understand your Net Worth, but then optimize for Savings Rate.
- Net Worth is an *accounting* formula, and uses different definitions for assets and liabilities. Explained in the 'Why Net Worth is Kind of Misleading' section below.
- It is *entirely possible* to have a fantastic Savings Rate at an awful Net Worth, and you will still be doing great financially because Savings Rate makes up for everything else. 
- It is *also entirely possible* to have a 7-figure Net Worth but only a single digit Savings Rate, and still be doing terribly.

## Why Net Worth is Kind of Misleading

Net Worth is the metric most financial advisors brag about improving, but it really does not make a difference to your financial picture. The 8 Stages of Financial Independence are defined by *cash flow*, not Net Worth! 

**Savings Rate makes up for pretty much everything else in personal finance.**

### - What is the definition of an asset? Or a liability?

In the *accounting* world, an asset is anything that has economic value (meaning it's worth something if you sell), but this does not contribute at all to your cash flow problem, and *"investing"* into these takes [Capital](/investing/financial-capital.md) away from **real assets** that provide cash flow and benefit you starting right now.

### - How we define assets and liabilities

We subscribe to the [Rich Dad Poor Dad definition of assets and liabilities](https://www.richdad.com/what-are-assets-and-liabilities).

- Assets are anything that *continually puts money into your pocket.*
- Liabilities are anything that *continually take money out of your pocket.*
