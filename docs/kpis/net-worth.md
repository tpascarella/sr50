# Net Worth

## Net Worth is Misleading

Net Worth is the metric most financial advisors brag about improving, but if you cut below the clever wordplay, you will see that Net Worth is an order of magnitude less important than both Savings Rate and Runway.

The Stages of Financial Independence are defined by *cash flow*, they are not defined *at all* by Net Worth.

It is entirely possible to have a great Savings Rate at an awful Net Worth, and still be doing great financially. It is also entirely possible to have an awful Savings Rate with a 7-figure Net Worth. 

Which would be more useful to you? $1,000,000 in a Roth IRA you have *no access to for the next 30 years* or $10,000 in passive income deposited into your checking account starting right now? 

Well, obviously.

## Takeaway

Net Worth is incredibly overblown in personal finance. It is a distant third compared to [Savings Rate](savings-rate.md) and [Runway](runway.md), and you should not overestimate it's importance.
