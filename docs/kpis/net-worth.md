# Net Worth

## Importance

Net Worth is the third most important KPI in personal finance, and it is a *distant third* when compared to Savings Rate and Runway.

## Calculating Net Worth

Net Worth is an accounting formula for: 

**Assets** minus **liabilities**

:::caution

You should know your Net Worth, but optimize for Savings Rate.

## Why Net Worth is Kind of Misleading

Net Worth is the metric most financial advisors brag about improving, but the Stages of Financial Independence are defined by *cash flow*, not Net Worth! 

It is entirely possible to have a great Savings Rate at an awful Net Worth, and still be doing great financially. It is also entirely possible to have an awful Savings Rate with a 7-figure Net Worth.

Savings Rate takes absolute priority!

### What counts as an asset? Or a liability?

Assets are things that continually put money into your pocket. Liabilities are things that continually take money out of your pocket.

In the *accounting* sense, an asset is anything that has economic value (meaning it's worth something if you sell), but you have a cash flow problem, and unless you stockpile things that generate cash flow, you won't make any progress.
