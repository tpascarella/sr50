# Runway

## Importance

Runway is the second most important KPI in personal finance. Runway tells you how long you can last off reserves if you had no income at all, measured in months.

:::tip 

This tells you how secure you are right now.

## How to Calculate Runway

Runway is calculated by dividing:

Your Bank Balance (how much cash you can get into your checking account within 48 hours) 

over

your average Burn (how much cash it costs you to live, on average). 

The resulting WHOLE NUMBER (you chop off the remainder) is your months of Runway.

:::note

When calculating Bank Balance you should only include liquid assets. Retirement accounts and equity in your home donâ€™t count, because they cannot be quickly and easily converted into cash.

## Average American Runway

Statistics vary, but the general consensus is that most Americans have less than 3 months of savings. Obviously, this is not good enough.

:::danger

Having this little of Savings to fall back on means that you are constantly within 3 months of financial collapse, should you lose your job.

You want at least 12 months of Runway underneath you. Whatever that number happens to be will be determined by how much money you spend every month.

:::caution Do you know your savings rate?

If you don't, that's a problem.

Figure it out.
