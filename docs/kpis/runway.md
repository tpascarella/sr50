# Runway

## Importance

Runway is the second most important KPI in personal finance.

Runway tells you how long you can last off reserves if you had no income at all, measured in months. Runway tells you how secure you are right now. 

The more months of Runway you have, the better.

## Calculating Runway

Runway is calculated by dividing your Bank Balance (how much cash you can get into your checking account within 48 hours) by your average Burn (how much cash it costs you to live, on average). 

>Bank Balance only includes liquid assets, so retirement accounts and equity in your home donâ€™t count.

## Average American Runway

Statistics vary, but the general consensus is that most Americans have less than 3 months of savings. Obviously, this is not good enough.

Your stress levels really plumet once you have 12 months of Runway to fall back on.
