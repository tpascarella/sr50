# Runway

>The 2nd most important KPI.

## Importance

Runway tells you how long you can last off reserves if you had no income at all, measured in a number of whole months.
>Essentially, Runway tells you how secure you are right now.

## Runway Calculation

<APITable>

| `Calculation` | - | - | - | - |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Your Bank Balance` | `DIVIDED BY` | `Your average Burn` | `GIVES YOU` | `Your $ of Months of Runway (rounded down)`|

</APITable>

### - Considerations

- *Bank Balance* is defined as all the cash you can get into your checking account within 48 hours without significant penalty.
- Bank Balance should only include highly liquid assets. Retirement accounts and home equity do not count because they cannot be quickly and easily converted into cash.
- *Average Burn* is defined as how much cash it costs you to live. (averaged over multiple months)
- The resulting months of Runway is rounded down because you can't only pay half your bills. I hear they don't like that.

## Average American Runway

Statistics vary, but the general consensus is that most Americans have less than 3 months of savings. Obviously, this is not good enough.

:::danger

Having this little of Runway to fall back on means you are ALWAYS within 3 months distance of bankruptcy if you lost your job.

:::

You want at least 12 months of Runway underneath you. Whatever that number happens to be will be determined by how much money you spend every month.

## Know Your Numbers!

:::caution Do you know how much runway you have?

If not, figure it out.
