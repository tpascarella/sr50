# Runway

Runway is calculated by dividing your Bank Balance (how much cash you can get into your checking account within 48 hours) by your average Burn (how much cash it costs you to live, on average). Bank Balance only includes liquid assets, so retirement accounts and equity in your home donâ€™t count. 

Runway tells you how long you can last off reserves if you had no income at all, measured in months. Essentially, how secure you are right now. 

The more months of Runway you have, the better.
