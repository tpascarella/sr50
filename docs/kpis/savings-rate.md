# Savings Rate

## Importance

Savings Rate is the most important KPI in personal finance. 

Savings Rate measures how much of your available resources you are utilizing to get your time back as a percentage. This tells you how *fast you are moving forward*. 

## Calculating Savings Rate

Savings Rate is calculated by dividing (how much money you are able to save or invest) by (your after-tax take home pay). 

The higher your Savings Rate, the better.
