# Savings Rate

## Importance of Savings Rate

Savings Rate is the most important KPI when figuring out how long it will take you to reach Financial Independence. Savings Rate measures, how much of your available resources you are utilizing to get your time back as a percentage. Essentially, how fast you are progressing. 

Savings Rate is calculated by dividing how much money you are able to save or invest, by your after-tax take home pay. The higher your Savings Rate, the better.

>Note that Savings Rate works exactly the same regardless of Income and Net Worth. A 50% Savings Rate works just as well at a $30,000 salary with 6 figures of student loans, as it does at someone with a $300,000 salary who is debt free.
