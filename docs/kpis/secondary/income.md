# Income

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

>Meaningless, except for how it impacts your Savings Rate.

## Importance

Income is the 4th most important KPI in personal finance, and a lot of people mistake it as being the most important.

### - Considerations

- A higher income is potentially better for reaching FI, IF AND ONLY IF it is accompanied by a correspondingly higher Savings Rate.
- Do not elevate your lifestyle as you begin making more and more money!

## Pitfalls of a Low Income

All of them. 

## Pitfalls of a High Income

There are many pitfalls exclusive to high income earners, such as:

### - Increased stress from jobs that pay that much

A lot of jobs that pay high salaries are very stressful and require working lots of hours, which kind of defeats the purpose of not being forced to trade time for money.

### - You can bury yourself into a much deeper hold

It is **much easier** to bury yourself into a financial hole making six figures than minimum wage. 

All of a sudden, credit card companies are offering you financing options left and right, which require ever increasing willpower to resist.

### - Societal pressures

As you make more money, societal pressure is higher to flaunt that wealth through expensive houses, cars and tech gadgets. Neurosurgeons can't expect to drive a 10 year old Honda Civic, right?

### - Lifestyle creep

Lifestyle creep is the term for elevating your lifestyle up to your current level of income, and is the reason six-figure earners have just as low of Savings Rates as people making modest incomes. If you increase your lifestyle because you are making more money, you completely erased the benefit of earning more money!

  <summary>Question: What's the first thing people go for when they get a big promotion?</summary>

- Nicer apartment
- Better car
- Fancy meals out 

The Big 3 expense categories often scale with your income, and should be avoided if possible.
