# Secondary Metrics

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

If I had to assign proportions to this, I would say Savings Rate is 100% important, Runway is 80% important, Net Worth is 15% important and Income is 10% important.

Keep in mind these assignments are completely subjective.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
