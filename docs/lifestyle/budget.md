# Budgets

## These are Probably a Good Idea

Budgets are especially useful for people who are not naturally frugal, or are currently digging themselves out of a financial hole. If you don’t want to use paper/pencil or a spreadsheet, (even though they’re so friggin’ useful!) There are lots of software options out there.

## They Become Non-Optional Once You're Married

The one exception to my “budgets are optional” rule is if you’re married. If you’re married, 100%, both of you need to budget together. Financial problems are one of, if not the, biggest cause of divorce, and a divorce will cost you a quarter million dollars.
