# Budgets

>Every dollar has an assignment.

## Optional, But Recommended

:::info

While budgets are not required (a minimalist mindset and living below your means are enough) they are still very useful and you should try them at least once.

:::

Budgets are especially helpful for people who are not naturally frugal, or people who are currently digging themselves out of a financial hole. 

### - Non-optional once you get married

:::caution

The one exception to my “budgets are optional” rule is if you’re married. If you’re married, 100%, both of you need to budget together. You need to be on the same page financially as your spouse, and a budget is the best way to get you both in sync.

Financial problems are one of, if not the, biggest cause of divorce, and a divorce will cost you a quarter million dollars. Minimum.

:::

Nobody says that you can't make budgeting fun, crack open a bottle of wine and make a date night out of it! Both you and your spouse need to be in agreement about where your money is going, so you might as well make it fun.

## Budgeting Tools

You can create a budget for free that works exactly the same as paid options, so consider these options first.

### - Free Options

#### - Paper and pencil

Paper and pencil budgets are what your grandparents did. The way you do them is to write at the top of the page exactly how much money you will make this upcoming month, then you give every dollar an assignment until you have a remaining balance of zero. Then you follow the budget like a written contract.

#### - EveryDollar

[EveryDollar](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/ramseyplus/everydollar) is Dave Ramsey's free budgeting app. It's basically a spreadsheet with a nice coat of paint, and does the job well enough.

#### - YNAB (You Need a Budget)

I personally have never used the [You Need a Budget software](https://www.youneedabudget.com/), I don't pay for things I can get for free, but have heard good reviews for it.
