# Budgets

>Every dollar has an assignment.

## Optional, But Recommended

:::info

While budgets are not required (a minimalist mindset and living below your means are enough) they are still very useful and you should try them at least once.

:::

Budgets are especially helpful for people who are not naturally frugal, or people who are currently digging themselves out of a financial hole. 

If you ARE single and naturally frugal, playing fast and loose with tracking isn't a huge issue.

### - Non-optional once you get married

:::caution

The one exception to my “budgets are optional” rule is if you’re married. If you’re married, you need to budget together. You need to be on the same page financially as your spouse, and a budget is the best way to get you both in sync. Financial problems are one of, if not the, biggest cause of divorce, try to avoid it.

:::

### - Gamification

There is no rule that says that you can't make budgeting enjoyable, crack open a bottle of wine and make a date night of it! A quick Google search can give you a lot of ideas to try.

## Budgeting Tools

You can create a budget for free that works exactly the same as paid options, so consider these options first.

#### - Paper and pencil

Paper and pencil budgets are what your grandparents did. The way you do them is to write at the top of the page exactly how much money you will make this upcoming month, then you give every dollar an assignment until you have a remaining balance of zero. Then you follow the budget like a written contract.

#### - EveryDollar

[EveryDollar](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/ramseyplus/everydollar) is Dave Ramsey's free budgeting app. It's basically a spreadsheet with a nice coat of paint, and does the job well.

I use EveryDollar because it's free and easy to use.

#### - YNAB (You Need a Budget)

I personally have never used the [You Need a Budget software](https://www.youneedabudget.com/), I don't pay for things I can get for free, but have heard good reviews for it.
