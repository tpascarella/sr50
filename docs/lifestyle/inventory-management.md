# Inventory Management

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

Minimalists are incredibly efficient at inventory management. 

Every item has a purpose, nothing goes to waste, you run very lean, and your possessions take up as little space as necessary (which makes moving cheaper and easier). I want you to treat making purchasing like a scheduled military resupply. Settle on a time frame between purchases (once a month is a good place to start) and take stock of what you need to stock up on. 

## Eliminates the Need for Willpower

If you know you will do your shopping in predictable intervals, you don't need to fight with yourself the other times to resist the temptation of going shopping.

## Types of Inventory

Your possessions can be divided into 2 categories, consumables and durables. Consumables are the things you bring in, use them up, and then replace them with more. Toothpaste, qtips, notebooks fall into this category. Durables are things that can be used repeatedly over a very long period of time. The cost of getting these purchases wrong is significantly higher. You can settle for a suboptimal shampoo for a month until you need to get another one, but getting the wrong laptop can be a much more expensive problem to fix. Be very deliberate in the decisions you make with your durables. They can be the most useful items you own, or the most useless. It is hard to never use a consumable assuming you bought it to use it, but durables gathering rust is a much bigger shame.

### - Consumables

Here are some rules of thumb when evaluating consumables:
- Do I seriously need this item?
- What function does it serve?
- Is that a legitimate function?
- Is there a better price, better product, or better overall solution for what I want to accomplish by using this item?
- Is there a zero waste substitute?
- Is there a DIY alternative?
- Can I use less?
- Does this make me stronger or weaker?
  - Drugs and alcohol are two good examples

### - Durables

Here are some rules of thumb for evaluating durables:
- How often will I use this item?
- Is it an in store good product or an at home good product?
- Would I recommend it to a friend or family member without having any incentive to, and at any time?
- What is an acceptable price I would pay for this item?
- Can I find a used version for a significantly cheaper price? You often can.

## Stores

### - Amazon

Amazon is great for buying small durable items, but not all items should be bought there. 

For example:
- items that are high risk of being counterfeit (rare collectibles)
- items that are high risk of being tampered with (crypto wallets)

should not be bought on Amazon.

## Use Credit Rewards

Once you have your shopping list ready, use a new credit card to make these purchases so you can get the rewards that come with them. Acquiring points and miles while doing the shopping you will need to do anyway, is a good way to maximize the efficiency of your dollars.

This strategy is known as [Travel Hacking](/credit/travel-hacking.md), and is covered in the [credit section.](/credit/index.md)

## Take Advantage of Sales

A lot of items have a long shelf life and can be stored for a long time. If you have the option to buy paper products or toothpaste at a discount, stocking up for the rest of the year is a smart idea.

Buying things in bulk and on sale gives an impressive ROI for your dollar.
