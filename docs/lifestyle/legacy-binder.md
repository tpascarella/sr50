# A Legacy Binder

![Ron Swanson Will](/img/rs-will.jpeg)
<br>
A Legacy Binder is the fancy term for all of the documents you will need to be passed to your loved ones after you pass.

While this might not reduce the *emotional drama* of your passing, having a legacy binder can greatly reduce the *legal drama* of your passing. 

## Where do I Get One?

## When Should I Fill This Out?

Sooner rather than later. It is important, but not urgent so don't let it fall through the cracks.

## Where Should I Keep This?

You should keep one copy of it in a safe in your house, as well as a digital backup in the cloud. It's also smart to give the code to your safe to an attorney to give to your relatives after your passing.
