# Legacy Binder

![Ron Swanson Will](/img/rs-will.svg)

A Legacy Binder is where you store all of the documents you will be passed to your loved ones after you die. The reason you want to have one is because, while it won't reduce the *emotional drama* of your passing, it will certainly reduce the *legal drama* of your passing. 

## Where Can I Get One?

[Here](https://www.epicsavers.world/our-resources/our-binders/).

## When Should I Fill This Out?

Sooner rather than later. It is important, but not urgent so don't let it fall through the cracks.

## Where Should I Keep It?

You should keep an updated copy in a safe in your house, as well as a digital backup in the cloud. It's also smart to give the code to your safe to an attorney to give to your relatives after your passing.
