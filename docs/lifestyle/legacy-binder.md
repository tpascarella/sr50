# Legacy Binder

![Ron Swanson Will](/img/meme-ron-swanson-will.svg)

A Legacy Binder is where you store all of the documents that will be passed to your loved ones after you die. 

The reason you want to have one is because, while it won't reduce the *emotional drama* of your passing, it will certainly reduce the *legal drama* for your loved ones. 

## Where Do I Get A Legacy Binder?

[Here](https://www.epicsavers.world/our-resources/our-binders/).

## When Should I Fill This Out?

Sooner rather than later. It is important, but not urgent so don't let it fall through the cracks.

:::tip 

Knock this out over the course of a weekend with your spouse, and revisit at least once a year after that. Add it to your calendar!

## Where Should I Keep It?

You should keep an updated copy in a safe in your house, as well as a backup in a safety deposit box that an attorney or executor of your estate has access to.

## Not a Substitute for a Will!

You will still need a will to dictate what happens to your empire, and a copy should be included in your legacy binder.

If you need to set up a will, a link to an online provider is included in the legacy binder link.
