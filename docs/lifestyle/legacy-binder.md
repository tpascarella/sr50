# Legacy Binder

>A collection of documents to be used after your passing.

A Legacy Binder is where you store all of the documents that will be passed to your loved ones after you die. The main reason you want to have one is because while it won't reduce the *emotional drama* of your passing, it will certainly reduce the *legal drama* for your loved ones. 

## Where Do I Get A Legacy Binder?

## When Should I Fill This Out?

Sooner rather than later. It's important but not urgent, so don't let it fall through the cracks.

Knock this out over the course of a weekend with your spouse, and revisit at least once a year after that. Add it to your calendar!

## Where Should I Keep It?

You should keep an updated physical copy in a safe in your house, a digital backup in the cloud, as well as a backup in a safety deposit box that an attorney or the executor of your estate has access to.

## This is Not a Substitute for a Will!

You still need a will to dictate what happens to your empire, and a copy should be included in your legacy binder.
