## Philosophy

Minimalism is not about owning a specific number of items, or living like a hermit. 

Minimalism is a lifestyle revolving around being intentional with all of your possessions, and removing all of the things that do not provide value so you can maximally invest in the things (and people) that do. It is about living simply, with as few possessions as needed to live a maximally meaningful life. Anything excess is a waste.

## Return on Investment

One of the big benefits of a minimalist lifestyle is that it builds very efficient spending habits. You buy far fewer items, and as a result, can save far more money!

Check out a few of the YouTube videos at the bottom and see if anything resonates. A half hour of Youtube can potentially prevent *decades* of inefficient purchasing decisions. That is a great ROI!

## Considerations

### - "Will this be in the final system?"

This is a helpful question to ask when decided whether to buy something. Some purchases, if you do them right, you never need to make again. 

Far into the future, will you still use this item regularly? If not, reconsider whether it's worth buying.

### - "Will I use this consistently?"

You don't need to use it every day, but it should have a purpose that you use it for on a consistent basis.

Everything you own should have some kind of purpose. You don't need to use it every day, but there should be a concrete reason you keep it around. If something is just sitting idle, see if you can find a new use for it.

### - "Will I still want this in 14 days?"

A lot of people get blinded by "shiny object syndrome", as I like to call it. If you can hold off making the purchase for 14 days, and come back wanting it **even more** than you did before, then go ahead and add it to one of your resupply lists.

### - Don't upgrade things for the sake of *buying stuff*

A lot of people look around their house looking for what they should upgrade next. But if the item you are thinking of replacing still has a lot of life left in it, and serves its purpose well enough, then it would be an inefficient use of capital to upgrade it just for the sake of getting the dopamine hit from making a purchase.

Itâ€™s also healthy to break yourself of the notion that everything always needs to be the latest and greatest version. It just needs to do its job.

:::

### - "A place for everything, and everything in its place"

Every possession should have a home. In a strange way, you're kind of *adopting* the item into your life. That item was spawned into the universe with a purpose, and it is *eager and willing to fulfill that purpose.* 

If it gets tossed into a landfill without ever getting the opportunity to be useful, that just sucks.

### - "Good Enough" is usually that

Most people obsess over owning the latest and greatest of everything. The minimalist stops and thinks whether "good enough" items are in fact good enough. 

:::note An Example

My favorite example for this point is headphones. 

A $1500 pair of headphones is not 10X better than a $150 pair of headphones, *it might only be 10% better.* It also becomes far more expensive to use and protect these items (you need to invest in expensive audio equipment to drive high impedence headphones).

:::

### - "I can't be a minimalist, I love shopping!"

People say they can't become a minimalist because they deeply enjoy shopping. 

The good news is, you'll still be shopping as a minimalist. You need to bring resources and supplies into your life to live. (food, clothing, etc) However as a minimalist, you purchase items that are:

- far more useful, 
- items of higher quality,
- items you will actually use,
- at way better prices! (because you took the time to shop around)

If you were to grade yourself on your purchases like a teacher would grade you on a test, being a minimalist will improve your grades in every category. 

:::tip Minimalism will make you a better shopper

In every aspect of the activity, you become a *better shopper.* And if you genuinely enjoy shopping, imagine how much you will enjoy it once you actually *get good.*

## Strategies

### - Decluttering

If you are brand new to minimalism, there is a big chance you have far too much stuff, and will need to begin downsizing. A fun way to get started is to do a [30 day challenge.](https://www.theminimalists.com/game/) 

Find someone to participate with you and do the following for 30 days:

- On the first day, find one item to get rid of (either throw away or donate). 
- On the second day, get rid of two items. 
- On the third day, get rid of three. 
- Repeat for all 30 days. 

Whoever lasts the longest wins!

### - Buying used items

You can buy perfectly good items used on Craigslist or Ebay, for much less than buying new at retail.

### - Treasure hunting

Once you have decided you want to buy something, the best way to go about buying it is a strategy I call, *treasure hunting*.

Don't buy things at the first moment you want them. Spend some time thinking about what you're going to use it for, how it will work with other items you have, and whether you really need it. If after careful consideration you decide it's worth it, then you scour eBay, Craigslist, Facebook marketplaces, and various other places until you find the exact item you want for significantly lower cost. 

>Paying retail is for suckers.

### - "Should I keep the boxes?"

If keeping the boxes provides the best option for safe transportation of items should you need to move, then that is a legitimate purpose and keeping them is a good idea. 

If the only function the boxes serve is to be a display on your shelf, I don't think it's worth the space.

### - Forgiving past mistakes

Fortune 50 companies have entire divisions dedicated to making accurate purchasing decisions for the upcoming quarters. They use cutting edge machine learning technology to minimize excess inventory as much as possible, and STILL so much crap ends up on clearance shelves.

Multi-billion dollar companies get purchasing decisions wrong all the time, so don't beat yourself up if you wasted money on some thing that you'll donate later for $0. The **real mistake** is to never learn from your mistakes to begin with.

## Find Your Hookshot

Many items provide no value to you. Some items you use every single day of your life and make it better in real and tangible ways. *Those kind of items are the ones worth investing in*. 

>Buy more things like that, slash and burn the rest.
