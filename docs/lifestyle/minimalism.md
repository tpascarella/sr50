# Minimalism

## Minimalism Philosophy

Minimalism is not about owning a specific number of items, or living like a hermit.

Minimalism is a process of being intentional with all of your possessions, and removing all of the things that do not provide value so you can invest maximally in the things, and people, that do.

It is about living simply, with as few possessions as needed to live a maximally meaningful life. Anything else is a waste.

## "Good Enough" is Almost Always That

Most people obsess over owning the latest and greatest of everything. The minimalist stops and thinks that "good enough" items are almost always that. 

My favorite example for this point is headphones. A $1500 pair of headphones is not 10X better than a $150 pair of headphones, it might be just 10% better.
