# Minimalism

## Philosophy

Minimalism is not about owning a specific number of items, or living like a hermit. 

Minimalism is a lifestyle revolving around being intentional with all of your possessions, and removing all of the things that do not provide value so you can maximally invest in the things (and people) that do.

It is about living simply, with as few possessions as needed to live a maximally meaningful life. Anything else is a waste.

>"There's only so much money a man really needs, the rest is just for showing off" -Forrest Gump

## Return on Investment

One of the big benefits of a minimalist lifestyle is that it builds very efficient spending habits. It isn't about living with a limited number of possessions, just restricting the things you own to the most important and valuable. 

Check out the following YouTube videos and see if anything resonates. 

A half hour of Youtube videos can potentially prevent *decades* of inefficient purchasing decisions. That is a great ROI!

## Considerations

### - "Will this be in the final system?"

Some purchases, if you do them right, you never need to make again. This is a helpful question to ask when decided whether to buy something. 

Once you finally get your shit together, will you still use this item regularly? If not, reconsider how badly you want this item.

### - "Will I use this consistently?"

You don't need to use it every day, but it should be used on a recurring basis for some purchase.

### - "Will I still want this in 14 days?"

A lot of people get blinded by "shiny object syndrome", as I like to call it.

If you hold off making the purchase for 14 days, and come back wanting it **even more** than you did before, then go ahead and add it to one of your resupply shopping lists.

### - Don't upgrade things for the sake of *buying stuff*

A lot of people look around their house looking for what they should upgrade next.

But, if the item you are thinking of replacing still has a lot of life left in it, and serves its purpose well enough, then it would be an inefficient use of capital to upgrade it just for the sake of getting the dopamine hit from making a purchase.

:::tip

Itâ€™s also healthy to break yourself of the notion that everything always needs to be the latest and greatest. It just needs to do its job.

:::

### - "A place for everything, and everything in its place"

Everything you own should have some kind of purpose. You don't need to use it every day, but there should be a concrete reason you keep it around. If something is just sitting idle, see if you can find a new use for it.

In a strange way, you're kind of *adopting* that item into your life. That item was spawned into the universe with a purpose, and it is eager and willing to fulfill that purpose. 

If it gets tossed into a landfill without getting the opportunity to be useful, that just sucks.

### - "Good Enough" is usually that

Most people obsess over owning the latest and greatest of everything. The minimalist stops and thinks whether "good enough" items are just that. 

:::note An Example

My favorite example for this point is headphones. A $1500 pair of headphones is not 10X better than a $150 pair of headphones, it might only be 10% better. 

It also becomes far more expensive to use and protect these items (you need to invest in expensive audio equipment to drive high impedence headphones).

:::

## Common Objections

### - "I can't be a minimalist, I love shopping!"

People say they can't become a minimalist because they deeply enjoy shopping. 

The good news is, you'll still be shopping as a minimalist. You need to bring resources and supplies into your life to continue existing (food, clothing, etc) literally everything is inventory management.

However as a minimalist, you purchase items that are:

- far more useful, 
- items that are higher quality,
- items you will actually use,
- at way better prices! (because you took the time to shop around)

:::tip Minimalism will make you a better shopper

In every aspect of the activity, you become a *better shopper.* 

And if you genuinely enjoy shopping, imagine how much you will enjoy it once you actually *get good.*

:::

## Strategies

### - Decluttering

If you are brand new to minimalism, there is a big chance you have far too much stuff, and will need to begin downsizing.

A fun way to get started is to do a 30 day detox. 

Find someone to participate with you and do the following for 30 days:

- On the first day, find one item to get rid of (either throw away or donate). 
- On the second day, get rid of two items. 
- On the third day, get rid of three. 
- Repeat this process for all 30 days. 

Whoever lasts the longest wins!

### - Buying used items

You can buy perfectly good items used on Craigslist or Ebay, for much less than buying new at retail.

This leads me nicely into the next strategy.

### - Treasure hunting

Once you have decided you want to buy something, what's the best way to go about buying it? I call this strategy, *treasure hunting*.

While treasure hunting, you scour eBay, Craigslist, Facebook marketplaces, and various other places until you find the thing you want at significantly lower cost. 

Don't buy things at the first moment you want them. Spend some time thinking about what you're going to use it for, how it will work with other items you have, and whether you really need it. If after careful consideration you decide it's worth it, then find your treasure.

:::tip

Paying retail is for suckers.

### - Military resupplies

Minimalists are incredibly efficient at resource management. Everything has a purpose, nothing goes to waste, you run very lean, and your possessions take up as little space as necessary (which makes moving cheaper and easier). I want you to treat making purchasing like a scheduled military resupply. 

Settle on a time frame between purchases (Once a month is a good place to start) and during that month expend some real effort doing research on the things you want to buy. 

:::note

Really evaluate how you will use it on a recurring basis and whether the price is worth the expected value.

:::

If you know you will do your shopping in predictable intervals, you don't need to fight with yourself the other times to resist the temptation of going shopping.

#### - Amazon

Amazon is great for buying small durable items, but there are some drawbacks using it for other items. However not all items should be bought there. 

For example:
- items that are high risk of being counterfeit. (crypto hardware wallet being an example)

should not be bought on Amazon.

### - Use credit rewards for these resupplies

Once you have your shopping list ready, try to use a new credit card to make these purchases so you can get the rewards that come with them. 

Acquiring points and miles while doing the shopping you will need to do anyway, is a good way to maximize the efficiency of your dollars.

### - Take advantage of sales

If items can be bought in bulk and on sale, do it!

A lot of items have a long shelf life and can be stored for a long time. If you have the option to buy paper products or toothpaste at a discount, stocking up for the rest of the year is a smart idea.

### - "Should I keep the boxes?"

If keeping the boxes provides the best option for safe transportation of items should you need to move, then that is a legitimate purpose and you can keep them. 

If the only function the boxes serve is to be a display on your shelf, I don't think it's worth the space.

### - Forgiving past mistakes

Fortune 50 companies have entire divisions dedicated to making accurate purchasing decisions for the upcoming quarters, with cutting edge machine learning technology to minimize excess inventory as much as possible, and STILL so much crap ends up on clearance shelves.

Multi-billion dollar companies make purchasing decisions wrong all the time, if you wasted money on some thing that you'll take an L on when you donate it for $0, at least you learned not to make that mistake in the future. The **real mistake** is to never learn from your mistakes to begin with.

## Find Your Hookshot

A lot of items provide no value to you. Some, you use every single day of your life and make it better in real and tangible ways. *Those kind of items are the ones worth investing in*. 

Buy more things like that, slash and burn the rest.
