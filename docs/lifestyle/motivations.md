# Having the Right Motivations

“Money” shouldn’t be the goal, it should be a resource that when properly managed, helps you achieve other more important goals.

## What Does Money Mean to You?

Ask yourself why you want to become financially independent. Common reasons include:
- Securing your family's financial future for generations
- Making sure your kids can graduate from college debt free
- Not having to answer to a piece of shit boss
- Not having to work for a piece of shit company
- Travel the world while you still have youthful energy
- Make a dent in the universe

Find your why.
