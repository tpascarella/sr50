# Resupplies

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

Minimalists are incredibly efficient at inventory management. 

Every item has a purpose, nothing goes to waste, you run very lean, and your possessions take up as little space as necessary (which makes moving cheaper and easier). I want you to treat making purchasing like a scheduled military resupply. Settle on a time frame between purchases (once a month is a good place to start) and take stock of what you need to stock up on. 

## Eliminates the Need for Willpower

If you know you will do your shopping in predictable intervals, you don't need to fight with yourself the other times to resist the temptation of going shopping.

## Stores

### - Amazon

Amazon is great for buying small durable items, but not all items should be bought there. 

For example:
- items that are high risk of being counterfeit (rare collectibles)
- items that are high risk of being tampered with (crypto wallets)

should not be bought on Amazon.

## Use Credit Rewards

Once you have your shopping list ready, use a new credit card to make these purchases so you can get the rewards that come with them. Acquiring points and miles while doing the shopping you will need to do anyway, is a good way to maximize the efficiency of your dollars.

This strategy is known as [Travel Hacking](/credit/travel-hacking.md), and is covered in the [credit section.](/credit/index.md)

## Take Advantage of Sales

A lot of items have a long shelf life and can be stored for a long time. If you have the option to buy paper products or toothpaste at a discount, stocking up for the rest of the year is a smart idea.

Buying things in bulk and on sale gives an impressive ROI for your dollar.
