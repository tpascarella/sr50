>Up to date information on imporant metrics.

I recommend keeping a screen in your house dedicated to dashboards for information you need to know:

- Mint, or some other balance sheet application
- EveryDollar, or some other cash flow tracking aplication
- Coinmarketcap, to keep track of your crypto balances
- Truflation, to keep track on inflation
