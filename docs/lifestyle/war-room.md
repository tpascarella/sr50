>Keeping up to date information on imporant metrics.

I recommend keeping a screen in your house dedicated towards dashboards for important information. You should always monitor these:

- [Mint,](https://mint.intuit.com/) or some other balance sheet application
- [EveryDollar,](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/ramseyplus/everydollar) or some other cash flow tracking aplication
- [Coinmarketcap,](https://coinmarketcap.com/portfolio-tracker/) to keep track of your crypto balances
- [Truflation,](https://app.truflation.com/) to keep track on inflation
- [Credit Karma,](https://www.creditkarma.com/) to keep track of your credit score and financing options
