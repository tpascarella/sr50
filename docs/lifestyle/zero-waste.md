# Zero Waste

Going zero waste is gaining traction as a lifestyle trend. It's not as popular as minimalism, but it's a logical next step after you have decluttered.

[The Zero Waste Home](https://zerowastehome.com/book/) is a great book you should read.

There are also plenty of zero waste swaps you can implement that will reduce your environmental impact, and it might also save you some money!
