# Problems

## "Financial Advisors" are Actually Insurance Salesmen

Another problem is that financial advisors are actually insurance salesmen who pose as financial advisors. 

### Look At Their Job Postings

Nearly every financial advisor in America is an *insurance salesman posing as a financial advisor*, and I discovered this personally when I was looking at financial advisor jobs after I graduated college. 

All of these positions have a commision style compensation plan, and those commissions come from selling EITHER unnecessary and bloated insurance packages, or criminally overpriced mutual funds. They don't get paid for what they know, they get paid for what they sell.

They try to hide this by using fancy advertising code, but all of the financial incentives are for these professionals to sell you as much insurance and investment products as they can.

There is an obvious divide between what a financial advisor should be in theory, and the actual logistics of the industry.

### The Job is Obsolete

You don't need to pay someone thousands of dollars to tell you that you should spend less than you earn and invest for the future. Calling them financial "advisors" is really intellectually misleading

The one exception is that you might want to bring on a tax professional when your portfolio is complicated enough to warrant it, but that likely doesn't apply to you yet. 

## Well Intentioned Bad Advice From People You Talk To

As mentioned earlier, most Americans are in a terribly weak financial position, and as a result they are not really qualified to provide you sound financial advice. A lof of them try, usually with good intentions, but they are not doing you much of a service.

Here are the most common pieces of financial advice people will give you that sound good on the surface, but is actually wrong.

### "You need to max out your retirement accounts" 

No you don't. What you need to do is build up passive income. 

*Cash flow* is the only thing that will give you your time back, and exclusively investing into accounts that do not provide cash flow and reduce the available capital you have to invest does not serve you well. In the traditional use case, you are not allowed to touch the money you invest until you turn 65. We can do better.

That isn't to say that retirement accounts have *no place* in your financial picture, but all of your focus should go towards investments that provide passive income *today*.

### "Going to university is a great career move"

Maybe, it all depends on the impact it'll have on your Savings Rate and Income.

It that degree can double your income, and you have access to grants from a reasonable school, then sure. Go for it. But saying "university is a great option" as *blanket career advice* is not a good idea. College is so god damn expensive, and should certainly never be entered *on impulse*.

### "You should pay off your house"

Paying off your house is an inefficient use of capital. 

Say you pay off your $200,000 mortgage. The return you get on your $200K in capital is that you don't have to pay your mortgage payment anymore. In effect, your $200,000 has given you a $1500/month swing in your Savings Rate. Also, how long would it take you to save up $200,000 in cash? 10 years? 20 years? 

There are many other options you can use that provide far greater swings to your Savings Rate, and those investments should absolutely take priority. You need to consider the opportunity cost of what else you can do with that money. With $200,000 you can use FHA loans towards multiple house hacks (covered in the [Housing](/spending/housing.md) section), a [franchise opportunity](/investing/franchises.md), or a shitload of [crypto](/investing/crypto.md).

#### Common Theme

A lot of bad advice stems from attempting to optimize Net Worth, or Income, *when your focus should really go towards maximizing your Savings Rate*. If you take care of Savings Rate, everything else will take care of itself.

:::caution 

Be very careful about your sources of information! Most Americans are terrible at managing their finances and as a result, are not qualified to offer you advice.

## No Savings, No Leverage, & No Options

The vast, overwhelming majority of Americans are in terrible financial shape. Their problem is that they elevate their lifestyle up to their level of income, trapping them with a single digit Savings Rate.

The consequence of having a low Savings Rate is that your Runway (the amount of time you can survive without a paycheck) never extends, which keeps you trapped at your current Stage of Financial Independence. 

It also makes it much harder to start building passive income with a low Savings Rate. You have no capital to invest, or a means to acquire more.

### Don't Sell Your Soul for Money

It's also soul crushing to work at an Initech type of company for a Lumbergh type boss.

Your time is your most valuable resource, yet people give it away for pennies on the dollar because they trap themselves with a high burn rate. Some of this is through stupidity, some from being dealt a bad hand, but whatever the cause, it is in your best interest to increase your Savings Rate so you can regain control of your most valuable asset.
