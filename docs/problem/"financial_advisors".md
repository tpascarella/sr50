# "Financial Advisors" are just Insurance Salesmen

## Look At Their Job Listings

Nearly every financial advisor in America is just an insurance salesman posing as a financial advisor.

I realized this personally as I was looking at financial advisor jobs after I graduated from college. All of them are commission based, and those commissions come from selling either unnecessary and bloated insurance packages, or criminally overpriced mutual funds. They offer nothing you can't easily do yourself after an hour of research on Google.

Check the [job listings](https://www.indeed.com/q-Financial-Advisor-jobs.html?vjk=179876bfb2533373) yourself and see! You will find all of the compensation packages are commission based, and those commissions come from selling insurance and shitty investment products. 

They hide that fact by using fancy marketing code, but all of the economic incentives for them are to sell as much insurance and crappy investment products as possible. It would be great if it was just a matter of "doing what's best for the client" but you can't expect people to not operate by personal incentive.

There is a very clear divide between what a financial advisor *should be* in theory, and the actual logistics of the profession. Don't be swindled by insurance salesmen!

## They are (Almost) Completely Unnecessary

Barring some very complicated tax situations, or estate planning, you don't need a financial advisor. The *math* of Financial Independence is sixth grade level. You don't need to pay someone else thousands of dollars to tell you that you should spend less than you earn, and invest for the future.

We are specifically competing with these *established financial advisor firms* by open sourcing everything we teach. We have taken the time and energy to compile all of the best information you can find on Google, and then give it away for free. 

## SR50 is Open Source

In an era where Google exists, you can't expect to succeed hiding information behind a paywall. We open source everything we teach, and get contributions from people all over the world. The result is that the SR50 method will only get better and more powerful as time goes on and more people contribute.

It is a disgrace these people call themselves "financial advisors". They are frauds, and we are going to beat them.
