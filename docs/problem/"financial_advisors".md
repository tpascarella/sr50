# "Financial Advisors" are just Insurance Salesmen

## Look At Their Job Listings

Nearly every financial advisor in America is just an insurance salesman posing as a financial advisor.

I realized this personally as I was looking at financial advisor jobs after I graduated from college. All of them are commission based, and those commissions come from selling either unnecessary and bloated insurance packages, or criminally overpriced mutual funds. They offer nothing you can't easily do yourself after an hour of research on Google.

Check the [job listings](https://www.indeed.com/q-Financial-Advisor-jobs.html?vjk=179876bfb2533373) yourself and see! You will find all of the compensation packages are commission based, and those commissions come from selling insurance and shitty investment products. Those are the annuities these companies want.

There is a very clear divide between what a financial advisor *should be* in theory, and the actual logistics of the profession.

## They are Unnecessary

Barring some very complicated tax situations, or estate planning, you don't need a financial advisor. The *math* of Financial Independence is sixth grade level. You don't need to pay someone else thousands of dollars to tell you that you should spend less than you earn, and invest for the future.

We are specifically competing with these *established financial advisor firms* by open sourcing everything we teach. We have taken the time and energy to compile all of the best information you can find on Google, and then give it away for free.
