# Well Intentioned Bad Advice

As mentioned in the Savings Rate section, most Americans have savings rates in the single digits. As a result, these people are not qualified to offer you financial advice. 

Here are some pieces of financial advice that sound good on the surface but are actually wrong.

### "You need to max out your retirement accounts!" 

No you do not. 

What you need is to build up passive income. *Cash flow* is the only thing that will give you your time back, and exclusively investing into accounts that you have no access to for decades do nothing to build passive income.

That isn't to say that retirement accounts have *no place* in your financial picture, but your focus should go towards investments that provide passive income to you, and you get a real tangible benefit from *now*.

### "Going to grad school is a great career move!"

It depends on what impact it will have on your Savings Rate and Income.

It that degree can double your income, and you have access to grants from a reasonable school, then sure. Go for it. But saying "grad school is a great option" as *blanket career advice* is not a good idea. Graduate school is expensive, and should certainly never be entered *on impulse*/

### "You should pay off your house!"

Paying off your house is an inefficient use of capital. Say you pay off your $200,000 mortgage, and don't have to pay your mortgage payment anymore. In effect, your $200,000 has given you a $1200/month swing in your Savings Rate.

You need to consider the opportunity cost of what else you can do with that money. With $200,000 you can use FHA loans on multiple house hacks (covered in the Housing section), a franchise opportunity, or business opportunities.

Also, how long would it take you to save up $200,000 in after tax liquidity? How many decades would that take you? There are many other options you can use that provide far greater swings to your Savings Rate, and those investments should absolutely take priority.

## Common Theme

A lot of the bad advice stems from trying to optimize Net Worth, or Income, when the single determiner of success is Savings Rate. If you take care of Savings Rate, everything else will take care of itself.

Be very careful about where you get your information. Remember the average Savings Rate in America is in the single digits. These people are not to be emulated.
