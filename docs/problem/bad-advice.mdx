# Well Intentioned Bad Advice

As mentioned earlier, most Americans are in a terribly weak financial position, and as a result they are not really qualified to provide you sound financial advice. A lof of them try, usually with good intentions, but they are not doing you much of a service.

Here are the most common pieces of financial advice people will give you that sound good on the surface, but is actually wrong.

## "You need to max out your retirement accounts!" 

No you don't. What you need to do is build up passive income. 

*Cash flow* is the only thing that will give you your time back, and exclusively investing into accounts that do not provide cash flow and reduce the available capital you have to invest does not serve you well. In the traditional use case, you are not allowed to touch the money you invest until you turn 65. We can do better.

That isn't to say that retirement accounts have *no place* in your financial picture, but all of your focus should go towards investments that provide passive income *today*.

## "Going to university is a great career move!"

Maybe, it all depends on the impact it'll have on your Savings Rate and Income.

It that degree can double your income, and you have access to grants from a reasonable school, then sure. Go for it. But saying "university is a great option" as *blanket career advice* is not a good idea. College is so god damn expensive, and should certainly never be entered *on impulse*.

## "You should pay off your house!"

Paying off your house is an inefficient use of capital. 

Say you pay off your $200,000 mortgage. The return you get on your $200K in capital is that you don't have to pay your mortgage payment anymore. In effect, your $200,000 has given you a $1500/month swing in your Savings Rate. Also, how long would it take you to save up $200,000 in cash? 10 years? 20 years? 

There are many other options you can use that provide far greater swings to your Savings Rate, and those investments should absolutely take priority. You need to consider the opportunity cost of what else you can do with that money. With $200,000 you can use FHA loans towards multiple house hacks (covered in the [Housing](/spending/housing.md) section), a [franchise opportunity](/investing/franchises.md), or a shitload of [crypto](/investing/crypto.md).

### Common Theme

A lot of bad advice stems from attempting to optimize Net Worth, or Income, *when the single determiner of success is Savings Rate*. If you take care of Savings Rate, everything else will take care of itself.

Be very careful about where you get your information!
