# "Financial Advisors" are just Insurance Salesmen

Another problem is that financial advisors 

## Look At The Job Listings

Nearly every financial advisor in America is an *insurance salesman posing as a financial advisor*, and I discovered this personally when I was looking at financial advisor jobs after I graduated college. 

All of these positions have a commision style compensation plan, and those commissions come from selling EITHER unnecessary and bloated insurance packages, or criminally overpriced mutual funds. They don't get paid for what they know, they get paid for what they sell.

They try to hide this by using fancy advertising code, but all of the financial incentives are for these professionals to sell you as much insurance and investment products as they can.

There is an obvious divide between what a financial advisor *should be* in theory, and the actual logistics of the profession.

## They're (Almost) Completely Unnecessary

You don't need to pay someone thousands of dollars to tell you that you should spend less than you earn and invest for the future. Calling them financial "advisors" is really intellectually misleading

The one exception is that you might want to bring on a tax professional when your portfolio is complicated enough to warrant it, but that likely doesn't apply to you yet.
