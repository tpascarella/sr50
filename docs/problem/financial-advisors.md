# "Financial Advisors" are just Insurance Salesmen

## Look At Their Job Listings

Nearly every financial advisor in America is just an insurance salesman posing as a financial advisor, which I discovered as I was looking at financial advisor jobs after I graduated from college. 

All of these positions are commission based, and those commissions come from selling either unnecessary and bloated insurance packages, or criminally overpriced mutual funds. They offer nothing you can't easily do yourself after an hour of research on Google. 

They try to hide this fact by using fancy marketing code, but the financial incentive for these professionals are to sell you as much insurance and investment products as they can.

[Here are the Linkedin postings if you want to verify.](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/financial-advisor-jobs/)

There is an obvious divide between what a financial advisor *should be* in theory, and the actual logistics of the profession.

## They are (Almost) Completely Unnecessary

Barring complicated tax situations, or estate planning, you don't need a financial advisor to reach Financial Independence and become wealthy. The *math* portion, is at a sixth grade level. 

You don't need to pay someone else thousands of dollars to tell you that you should spend less than you earn, and invest for the future. We are specifically competing against these *established financial advisor firms* by open sourcing everything we teach. We have taken the time and energy to compile all of the best information you can find on Google, and then present it through this website. 

## SR50 is Open Source

In an era where Google exists, you can't expect to succeed hiding information behind a paywall. We open source everything we teach, and get contributions from people all over the world. The result is that the SR50 method will only get better and more powerful as time goes on and more people contribute. It is a disgrace these people call themselves "financial advisors". They are frauds, and we are going to beat them.
