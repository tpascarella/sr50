# No Savings, No Leverage, & No Options

A consequence of having a low Savings Rate is that your Runway (the amount of time you have without a paycheck) never extends. It keeps you trapped at your current Stage of Financial Independence

Your Runway gives you the leverage to look for a higher paying job, a job at a better company (with better opportunities), or even just to not have to put up with a boss you hate.

It is also impossible to start building up passive income with a low Savings Rate. Passive income is the cash flow that will replace your salary, and you need to invest strategically in order to get it. If you cannot invest a sizable portion of your income, you will never accumulate enough passive income in order to get it.
