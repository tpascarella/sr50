# No Savings, No Leverage, & No Options

The vast, overwhelming majority of Americans are in terrible financial shape. Their problem is that they elevate their lifestyle up to their level of income, trapping them with a single digit Savings Rate.

The consequence of having a low Savings Rate is that your Runway (the amount of time you can survive without a paycheck) never extends, which keeps you trapped at your current Stage of Financial Independence. 

It also makes it much harder to start building passive income with a low Savings Rate. You have no capital to invest, or a means to acquire more.

## Don't Sell Your Soul for Money

It's also soul crushing to work at an Initech type of company for a Lumbergh type boss.

Your time is your most valuable resource, yet people give it away for pennies on the dollar because they trap themselves with a high burn rate. Some of this is through stupidity, some from being dealt a bad hand, but whatever the cause, it is in your best interest to increase your Savings Rate so you can regain control of your most valuable asset.
