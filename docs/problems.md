# Common Problems

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

## Misconceptions About "Work 'til You're 65"

The first problem is that our grandparents' advice of "Get a job, put 15% into a 401k, and work there until 65" does not apply in this day and age. 

They were fortunate enough to live in an era where a Bachelor's degree was enough to get you a good job at a good company, and you could be sure you'll have job security and a pension for the rest of your life. That is not the world my generation (Gen Z) will grow old in. 

### - "Golden years"

People think your golden years are 65+ when you have enough money to never need to work again, but I would argue that your golden years are when your kids are between 0-4.

They might be the highest stress years of your life, but you have the energy to overcome it and can build family memories that you will *never have the opportunity to repeat.* Do not let the time pass you by!

### - 65 is NOT a finish line

![Age](/img/meme-decades-of-work.svg)

The objective of personal finance is to put yourself in a position where you never need to trade your time for money again, and there is **absolutely no reason to think that this magically occurs once you turn 65.**

:::note

The reason everyone thinks of 65 as retirement age is because this is the age at which you can access your 401K and Roth IRA funds without having to pay taxes on the gain. 

Age says absolutely nothing about your Savings Rate, it says nothing about your Runway, and has no impact on your passive income!

:::

401K's and Roth IRA's are the only kind of investments most people ever make, and you can achieve the same amount of financial independence within 3-5 years, instead of 30-40, **if you invest aggressively and sustain a high Savings Rate.**

## "Financial Advisors" are Actually Just Insurance Salesmen

Another problem is that financial advisors are actually insurance salesmen *who pose as financial advisors.* 

They sell you (bad) investment products and insurance, and are paid by commisions.  They try to hide this by using fancy marketing code, but all of the financial incentives are for these professionals to sell you as much insurance and investment products as they can.

### - Check the listings yourself

Nearly all financial advisor jobs have a commision style compensation plan, and those commissions come from selling either unnecessary and bloated insurance packages, or criminally overpriced mutual funds. 

:::danger Don't believe me?

Check out some financial advisor [jobs on LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/financial-advisor-jobs?position=1&pageNum=0) 

:::

You'll see some similarities:

- "Uncapped earnings potential!"
- "Series 7 & 66 required, insurance licenses also required"
- "Entrepreneurial spirit, building your 'book of business'"
- "Sales experience preferred"

There is a clear divide between what a financial advisor *should be,* in theory; and the actual logistics of the industry. **Financial advisors don't get paid for the knowledge they have, they get paid commissions on the products they sell.**

### - The job is obsolete now

You don't need to *pay someone thousands of dollars* to tell you to spend less than you earn and invest for the future. 

We have access to Google (and this website), and these options can provide infinitely better service, at substantially lower cost than *"the professionals"*.

## Well Intentioned, Bad Advice

Most Americans are horrible on all of the [KPIs](kpis/index.md) that matter. As a result **none of them are qualified to offer you financial advice.**

A lot of them try to, usually out of good intentions, but they are not doing you much of a service.

:::caution 

Be very careful about where you get your information! A lot of people try to offer you financial advice, but they do not have the knowledge or experience to actually be useful.

:::

Here are the most common pieces of financial advice you will hear:

### - "You need to max out your retirement accounts!" 

No you don't. What you need is build up passive income. 

*Cash flow* is the only thing that will give you your time back, and exclusively investing into accounts that do not provide cash flow, and also reduces the capital you have to invest is terribly inefficient. 

:::note 

This isn't to say that retirement accounts have *zero place* in your financial roadmap, but all of your focus, and all of your capital, should go towards investments that generate cash flow and move you closer to solving the FFE, *today*.

:::

In their designed use case, you are not allowed to touch the money in these accounts until you turn 65. I reject the premise.

### - "Going to university is a great career move!"

Maybe, but not always. It depends on the impact your degree will have on your Savings Rate and your Income. If that degree can double your income, and you have access to grants, then sure, go for it. 

However, saying "university is a great option" as *one-size fits all, blanket career advice* is incredibly stupid. College is expensive, and certainly should never be entered *on impulse*.

### - "My house is the best investment I've ever made!"

Paying off your house is another inefficient use of capital. 

:::caution Considerations

Say you have a $200,000 balance on your mortgage, and you decide to pay it off:

1. How long would it take you to save up $200,000 in cash? 10 years? 20 years?
2. What is the return you will make on your $200,000? Not having to pay a mortgage payment anymore.
>In effect, that $200,000 has returned to you, a SINGLE MORTGAGE PAYMENT's swing to your Savings Rate. 

::: 

There are *many better investments* you can make that provide far greater swings to your Savings Rate, with far lower capital requirements, and those investments should get absolute priority. 

You need to consider the opportunity cost of what else you can do with that money. With $200,000 you can use FHA loans towards multiple [house hacks](/spending/housing.md), a [franchise purchase](/investing/boomer-investments/franchises.md), or a substantial portfolio of [crypto](/investing/gen-z-investments/cryptocurrency.md).

## Americans Have No Savings, No Leverage, & No Options

The average Savings Rate in America is about 8%.

:::note Current statistics

Current Savings Rate data can be found at the [Federal Reserve Economic Data website here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT).

::: 

One consequence of having a single digit Savings Rate is that your Runway (the length of time you can survive without a paycheck) never increases, you never build up that buffer between yourself and bankruptcy. Since you never progress, this keeps you trapped at your current Stage of Financial Independence indefinitely. 

It's also much harder to build any passive income with a low Savings Rate. You have no capital to invest, or have any means to means to acquire more. 

### - No choice but to sell your soul to Lumbergh

Another consequence of having a low Savings Rate is that you're trapped at *whatever job keeps the bills paid.* You don't have the Runway (time) needed to find or pursue any better opportunities.

Not to mention it's just soul crushing to work at an Initech type of company, for a Bill Lumbergh type boss.

## Common Theme

A lot of these problems stem from attempting to optimize Net Worth or Income, *when your focus should really go towards maximizing your Savings Rate*. 

**If you optimize for Savings Rate, everything else will take care of itself.**
