# Common Problems

## "Work 'til You're 65" Does Not Apply Anymore

Your parents' advice of "Get a job, put 15% into a 401k, and work that job until you're 65" is does not apply anymore. 

They were fortunate enough to live in an era where an undergraduate degree was enough to get you a good job at a good company, and you could be reasonably sure you'll have job security for the rest of your life. However, our generation is coming up in an era with automation breathing down our necks. 

The financial advice that might have worked for your grandparents, does not apply anymore.

### Why 65?

Time is the only resource you can never buy more of. It is for this reason that time is the most important *thing* that money can buy. 

![Age](/img/age-meme.svg)

The whole point of personal finance is to put yourself in a position where you never need to trade your time for money again, and there is no reason to think that this *magically* occurs once you turn 65.

The reason everyone around you thinks of 65 as retirement age is because this is the age at which you can access your 401K and Roth IRA funds without paying taxes. Those types of investments are the only kind of investing most people ever do, and I am telling you that you can achieve the same level of financial independence within 3-5 years, instead of 30-40, if you invest aggressively and can reach a high Savings Rate. 

## "Financial Advisors" are Actually Insurance Salesmen

Another problem is that financial advisors are actually insurance salesmen who pose as financial advisors. They try to hide this by using fancy advertising code, but all of the financial incentives are for these professionals to sell you as much insurance and investment products as they can.

### Look at their job postings

Nearly every financial advisor in America is an *insurance salesman posing as a financial advisor*, which I discovered personally as I was looking at financial advisor jobs after I graduated from college. 

All of these positions have a commision style compensation plan, and those commissions come from selling *EITHER* unnecessary and bloated insurance packages, or criminally overpriced mutual funds. 

They don't get paid for what they know, they get paid for what they sell.

:::danger They Sell You Insurance & Are Paid By Commission

There is an obvious divide between what a financial advisor should be in theory, and the actual logistics of the industry.

### The job is now obsolete

You don't need to pay someone thousands of dollars to tell you that you should spend less than you earn and invest for the future. We have access to Google (and this website) and these options can provide *infinitely better service* than these *"licensed professionals"*.

The one exception is that you might want to hire a tax professional once your portfolio is complicated enough to warrant such a hire, but that likely doesn't apply to you yet. 

### YOU are your own best financial advisor

Trust your judgement and make better and bets as you get more information.

## Well Intentioned, But Bad Advice

Most Americans are in a terribly brittle financial position, and as a result they are *not qualified* to provide you any financial advice. 

:::caution 

Be very careful about where you get your information! A lot of people try to offer you financial advice, but they do not have the knowledge or experience to actually be useful, and they are not doing you much of a service.

:::

Here are the most common pieces of financial advice people will give you:

### "You need to max out your retirement accounts" 

No you don't. What you need to do is build up passive income. 

*Cash flow* is the only thing that will give you your time back, and exclusively investing into accounts that do not provide cash flow and reduce the available capital you have to invest does not serve you well. In the traditional use case, you are not allowed to touch the money you invest until you turn 65. We can do better.

:::note 

This isn't to say that retirement accounts have *no place* in your financial picture, but all of your focus, and all of your capital, should go towards investments that generate cash flow *today*.

:::

### "Going to university is a great career move"

Maybe. 

It depends on the impact it'll have on your Savings Rate and Income. If the degree can double your income, and you have access to grants from a reasonable school, then sure. Go for it. 

But saying "university is a great option" as *one-size fits all, blanket career advice* is stupid. College is really god damn expensive, and should never be entered *on impulse*.

### "You should pay off your house"

Paying off your house is an inefficient use of capital. 

Say you pay off your $200,000 mortgage. The return you get on your $200K in capital is that you don't have to pay your mortgage payment anymore. In effect, your $200,000 has given you a mortgage payment's worth of swing in your Savings Rate. Also, how long would it take you to save up $200,000 in cash? 10 years? 20 years? 

There are many other investments you can make that provide far greater swings to your Savings Rate, with far lower capital requirements, and those investments should get priority. 

You need to consider the opportunity cost of what else you can do with that money. With $200,000 you can use FHA loans towards multiple house hacks (covered in the [Housing](/spending/housing.md) section), a [Franchise purchase](/investing/franchises.md), or a sizable portfolio of [Crypto](/investing/crypto.md).

### Common theme

A lot of bad advice stems from attempting to optimize Net Worth, or Income, *when your focus should really go towards maximizing your Savings Rate*. If you take care of Savings Rate, everything else will take care of itself.

## No Savings, No Leverage, & No Options

The average Savings Rate in America is about 8%.

The consequence of having a single digit Savings Rate is that your Runway (the length of time you can survive without a paycheck) never increases, which keeps you trapped at your current Stage of Financial Independence. 

It's also much harder to start building passive income with a low Savings Rate. You have no capital to invest, or a means to acquire more. A high Savings Rate gives you infinitely more options over how to spend your time.

### You have no choice but to sell your soul for money

Another consequence of having a low Savings Rate is that you are trapped in whatever job keeps the bills paid. You don't have the Runway (the time) needed to find or pursue a better opportunity.

Not to mention it's soul crushing to work at an Initech type company, for a Lumbergh type boss.

## Takeaway

Your time is your most valuable resource, yet people give it away for pennies on the dollar because they trap themselves with a high burn rate. 

Some of this is through sheer stupidity, some from being dealt a bad hand in life, but whatever the cause, it is in your best interest to increase your Savings Rate so you can regain control of your most valuable asset.
