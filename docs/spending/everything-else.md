# Everything Else

## Importance

These are the categories that fall outside of the Big 3. 

These are the categories people most often cut out in an attempt to save money, and it's largely wasted effort.

## Breakdown

The following are the percentages for different expense categories from the [2020 Consumer Expenditures Report](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/consumer-expenditures/2020/pdf/home.pdf):

- Alcoholic Beverages: - .8%
- Apparel and Services - 2.3%
- Healthcare - 8.4%
- Entertainment - 4.7%
- Personal Care Products and Services - 1.1%
- Reading - .2%
- Education - 2.1%
- Tobacco Products and Smoking Supplies - .5%
- Miscellaneous - 1.5%
- Cash Contrubutions - 3.7%
- Personal Insurance and Pensions - 11.8%

### (for the most part) You can keep these

If you are frugal in the Big 3 expense categories, you can reach a high Savings Rate and donâ€™t need to stress about the other categories, since they will provide a marginal (at best) increase to your Savings Rate.

### Notable exceptions

- The only advice I can give with regards to reducing healthcare costs is to try your best to keep yourself healthy.

:::info Control what you can control:

Eat reaonably healthy food, exercise regularly, don't smoke cigarettes, or do any other activities that are needlessly detrimental to your physical health.
