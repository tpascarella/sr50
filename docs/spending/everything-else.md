### - (within reason) You can keep these

**If you are frugal in the Big 3 expense categories,** you don't need to stress about these expenses. Focusing on the Big 3 can get your Savings Rate where it needs to be, so keep the fun things!

### - Some exceptions

#### - Healthcare

The only advice I can give with regards to reducing healthcare costs is to try your best to keep yourself healthy.

:::info Control what you can control:

Eat healthy foods, exercise, don't smoke cigarettes or do any other activities that are needlessly detrimental to your physical health.

You can't control whether you get cancer, but you have a lot of control over your body composition is made up.
