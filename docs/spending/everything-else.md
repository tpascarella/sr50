# "Everything Else"

## For the Most Part, You Can Keep These

These are the categories people most often cut out in an attempt to save money, and it's largely wasted effort. A 1% increase in your Savings Rate is not worth isolating yourself from your friends, so keep the fun stuff! (Within reason, this should never be misinterpreted as permission to be stupid)

Housing, Transportation and Food make up 62% of the average American’s spending. If you are frugal in these categories, you can reach a high Savings Rate and don’t need to stress about the other categories.
