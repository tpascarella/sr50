# Food

## Importance

**You always spend more than you think you do on food. Every time, without exception.**

## Breakdown

Peoples' food bills are usually split pretty evenly between buying groceries and eating out. 

:::tip 

You should always default to cooking your meals.

### - Eating out

For eating out, the best advice I can give is to just never do it. It’s unhealthy, it’s expensive, and can usually be prevented with a bit of forethought. 

:::danger 

Despite what the nutrition facts sheet may claim, restaurant food is often worse for you than you think. 

They are in the business of selling tasty food, not food that is good for you.

:::

### - Buying groceries

Plan out your grocery trips so you only need to go once a week. Grocery stores are designed so you'll buy way more than you intially intended. 

So only go once a week, and bring a list. 

:::tip Some Tips For Lowering Your Grocery Bills
- bring a grocery list based off the weekly ad,
- take advantage of BOGO deals and discounts, 
- keep your freezer stocked with protein, 
- stockpile paper products and other staples when they’re on sale,  
- buy bulk items at Costco first, then get the rest from other grocery stores. 

:::

If you follow these rules, you should have a cabinet full of reasonably healthy food that won't cost you an arm and a leg. 

## Cooking

Cooking is a valuable life skill you should continually develop, it's a lifelong process. 

You are quite literally crafting the sustenance you need to survive, so get good at it! People will like you more if you feed them. 

:::note "But I don't know how to cook!" You cry

You have Google. Use it.

:::

Find 5 recipes online that look good and try making them! It doesn't matter whether they're healthy at first, the important thing is that you start, and that you build the habit to cook your own food. You'll get better at it as time goes on, and will be shocked how much better food tastes when you cook it yourself.

### - Physical health is an investment

Gradually try to get at least 80% of your calories from nutritious foods that you like. Your physical health is an investment, so don’t live on Ramen to save money any longer than is absolutely necessary.
