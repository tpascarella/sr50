# Food

You always spend more than you think you do on food. Every time, without exception.

On average, peoples' food bills are split pretty evenly between buying groceries and eating out. You should always default to cooking healthy food, that you bought from reasonable grocery stores.

## Eating Out

For eating out, the best advice I can give is to just never do it. It’s unhealthy, it’s expensive, and can usually be prevented with a bit of forethought. 

## Buying Groceries

Plan out your grocery trips so you only need to go once a week, and never shop when you’re hungry. Grocery stores are engineered so you'll buy way more than you intended, so only go once a week and come with a list. 

Here are some tips:
- bring a grocery list based off the weekly ad,
- take advantage of BOGO deals and discounts, 
- keep your freezer stocked with protein, 
- stockpile paper products and other staples when they’re on sale,  
- buy bulk items at Costco first, then get the rest from other grocery stores. 

If you do these, you should have a cabinet full of reasonably healthy food that won't cost you an arm and a leg. 


## Cooking

Learn how to cook. Cooking is a valuable life skill you should develop, and it's a lifelong process. You are quite literally crafting the sustenance you need to survive, so get good at it! People will like you more if you feed them. 

>“But I don't know how to cook!” you cry! 

You have Google, use it. Find 5 recipes online that look good and try making them! It doesn't matter whether they're healthy at first, the important thing is that you start, and that you make it a habit to cook your own food. You'll get better at it as time goes on. You'd be surprised how much better food tastes when you cook it yourself.

Over time, gradually try to get at least 80% of your calories from nutritious foods that you like. Your physical health is an investment, so don’t live on Ramen to save money any longer than is absolutely necessary. Your physical health takes priority over your wallet.
