# Housing

## Buy vs. Rent

“Buy vs. Rent” is a bullshit question. It’s a bullshit question because the thinking is too narrow. I reject the premise. Do not limit your options to one of two choices presented to you by a nation with a single digit Savings Rate. 

Conventional wisdom says that “renting is throwing money away, so buying is better.” But it's not that simple. Paula Pant of AffordAnything.com has a great article comparing the financial differences between buying and renting in detail (linked in the bonus report). When deciding between buying and renting, you need to consider the opportunity cost of:
having a lot of cash tied up in a down payment, which greatly reducing your Runway,
becoming responsible for any maintenance or repairs,
locking yourself geographically to one location for decades, potentially limiting employment opportunities,
taxes, insurance, HOA fees, and a million other things.

In the grand scheme of the situation, the financial difference between buying and renting is negligible at most. The decision typically ends up being decided by lifestyle factors rather than mathematical ones. 

But, here's the reason why I believe the question is stupid. What is the difference between a $900 a month rent payment and a $900 a month mortgage payment to your Savings Rate? Zero, right? 
The question you should really be asking is “how do I situate my Housing so it has the minimum possible detrimental effect on my Savings Rate?” Once you look at the problem this way, a clear winner emerges. 

## House Hacking

House hacking (the term) was coined by an [article](https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-11-02-hack-housing-get-paid-live-free) written by Brandon Turner of BiggerPockets.com, first introduced to me in [Set for Life](https://www.amazon.com/Set-Life-Dominate-Money-American-ebook/dp/B06Y15M786/ref=sr_1_2?crid=36UFYADVB3E65&dchild=1&keywords=set+for+life+scott+trench&qid=1628033342&sprefix=set+for+life+scott%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-2) by Scott Trench (highly recommended).

The concept is simple. You buy a 1-4 unit property with an FHA loan (3.5% down), and then rent out any spare bedrooms or units so that the cash flow from those units offset your burn for Housing. 

If you do this, you can completely eliminate your cash outflow for Housing (your single largest expense) while also enjoying all the other wealth building benefits real estate investing offers. This is a cheat code to life, and is very worth your time learning how to use.

For House Hacking, any income generation is fair game, be it renting out a room full time, hosting on Airbnb, or even having people park on your lawn for football games. I’ll reference some great articles and videos on it in the bonus report. The one rule of House Hacking is that the property should cash flow as a rental once you move out.

## Alternative Strategies

An easier (although less powerful) option is to make your current home more energy efficient. Options include installing more energy efficient appliances (like smart bulbs and thermostats), as well as better insulation for doors and windows. If you plan to live in your current property for a long time, and want to reduce the utility costs of running the house, these are good options.

Building a tiny house is also kind of trendy now, and so is living in an RV and touring the country if you can work remotely. Personally, I would just house hack, but these are equally valid, mortgage free options.

If you will be moving in the near future and need flexibility, you can also temporarily live in Airbnbs instead of signing a full 12-month lease. This is great if you need to figure out any details of your work life while testing the waters living in a new city, and is also a good way to test moving out of your parents’ house for the first time. The prices month to month will likely be similar to renting, so it's worth considering. 

I don’t recommend moving in with your parents to save cash, however. It will stifle your personal development and should only be considered as a last resort. 

## Airbnb

Airbnb offers a way to rent out the spare room in your house, or rent other peoples' spaces. This can be an exciting way to make money off of the extra space you have, and depending how valauble your space is, can reap similar financial benefits to house hacking.

You can also live in them temporarily to test the waters in a new city you want to travel to.
