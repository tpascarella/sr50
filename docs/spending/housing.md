# 33% - Housing

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

>Live in cheap apartments until you can house hack.

## Importance

Housing is the single largest expense categories for most Americans, taking up roughly a third of your take home pay.

The good news is that this expense can be offset entirely through a strategy called house hacking explained below, however it will require a bit of capital to start.

## Buy vs. Rent is a Bullshit Question

Conventional wisdom states that *“renting is throwing your money away, so buying is better.!”* But it's not that simple. 

You need to consider the opportunity cost of:
- having a lot of cash tied up in a down payment, which greatly reducing your Runway,
- becoming responsible for any maintenance or repairs,
- locking yourself geographically to one location for decades, potentially limiting employment opportunities,
- taxes, insurance, HOA fees, and a million other things.

In the grand scheme of things, the financial difference between buying and renting is negligible at most. The decision typically ends up being decided by lifestyle factors rather than mathematical ones. 

:::note

Paula Pant from AffordAnything.com has a [great article comparing the financial difference between renting and buying](https://affordanything.com/is-renting-better-than-buying-should-i-rent-or-buy/) that you should read.

Don't limit yourself to **1 of 2 options** presented to you by a nation with a single digit Savings Rate. There are more than 2 available!

### - The question you should really be asking

Here's the reason why the "buy vs rent" question is stupid. What's the difference between a $900 a month rent payment, and a $900 a month mortgage payment, *to your Savings Rate?* 
>**Zero.**

The question you should really ask is “how do I situate my Housing so it has the minimum possible detrimental effect to my Savings Rate?” **Once you look at your housing options through the impact they have on your Savings Rate, a clear winner emerges.** 

## House Hacking

House hacking (the term) was coined by an [article by Brandon Turner](https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-11-02-hack-housing-get-paid-live-free) of BiggerPockets.com, first introduced to me in [Set for Life](https://www.amazon.com/Set-Life-Dominate-Money-American-ebook/dp/B06Y15M786/ref=sr_1_2?crid=36UFYADVB3E65&dchild=1&keywords=set+for+life+scott+trench&qid=1628033342&sprefix=set+for+life+scott%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-2) by Scott Trench (highly recommended). Here's how it works.

You buy a 1-4 unit property using an FHA loan (requires a 3.5% down payment), then rent out any spare bedrooms or units so that the rents from those units offset your mortgage payment. 

>If you do this successfully, you can *completely offset your cash outflow for Housing* (your single largest expense) while enjoying all the other wealth building benefits real estate investing offers.

### - The one rule of house hacking

The one rule of House Hacking is that the property needs to cash flow as a rental once you move out. If once you move out of it you start losing hundreds or thousands of dollars a month, that moves you further from solving the FFE, not closer!

## Other Strategies

### - Energy efficient appliances

Anything you can do to make your home more energy efficient will reduce the ongoing utility costs for that property. If you will be living in (or managing) the property for longer than the payback period for different appliances, then installing them will increase net profits to you.

[This article from Direct Energy](https://www.directenergy.com/learning-center/25-energy-efficiency-tips) lists 25 easy options for making your home more efficient.

### - Build a tiny house

Tiny houses are gaining traction as a lifestyle movement, and can be significantly cheaper than a typical home purchase. Some tiny houses can be built for less than $8000!

[This article from Rocket Mortgage](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/how-much-does-a-tiny-house-cost#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20a,caught%20up%20in%20the%20savings.) does a great job explaining the costs of tiny houses and what to expect.

### - Full time RVing

If you have the option to work anywhere and like the idea of travelling the country full time, RVing just might be for you.

[A Beginners Guide to Living in an RV](https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-Living-Everything-Full-Time-ebook/dp/B0778WS6X4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=alyssapacom0b-20&linkId=6dccc5743bf4b4aea02389c34462a009) is the best book I've read about full time RVing.

### - Airbnb

[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) offers a way to make money renting out the spare room in your house. This can be an exciting way to make money off of the extra space you have, and depending how valauble your space is, can reap similar financial benefits to house hacking.

If you will be moving in the near future and need flexibility, you can also temporarily live in Airbnbs instead of signing a full 12-month lease. This is great if you need to figure out any details of your work life while testing the waters living in a new city, and is also a good way to test moving out of your parents’ house for the first time. The prices month to month will likely be similar to renting, so it's worth considering. 

## The Single Worst Thing You Can Possibly Do

The worst thing you can possibly do is to buy a cripplingly expensive house, maxing out on the minimum payment you can *"afford"*. The down payment for this house likely obliterated your Runway, and since you maxed out on the payment, your Savings Rate has been seriously hindered as well.

This is one of the single most detrimental financial decisions someone can make, since they have crippled the 2 most important KPIs in personal finance!
