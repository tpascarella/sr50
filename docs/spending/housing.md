# Housing

## Importance

Housing is the single largest expense categories for most Americans, taking up roughly a third of your take home pay.

## Buy vs. Rent is a Bullshit Question

“Buy vs. Rent” is a bullshit question because the premise is needlessly restrictive.

:::caution

Do not limit yourself to 1 of 2 options presented to you by a nation with a single digit Savings Rate.

:::

Conventional wisdom says that “renting is throwing money away, so buying is better.” But it's not that simple. You need to consider the opportunity cost of:
- having a lot of cash tied up in a down payment, which greatly reducing your Runway,
- becoming responsible for any maintenance or repairs,
- locking yourself geographically to one location for decades, potentially limiting employment opportunities,
- taxes, insurance, HOA fees, and a million other things.

:::note

Paula Pant of AffordAnything.com has a [great article](https://affordanything.com/is-renting-better-than-buying-should-i-rent-or-buy/) comparing the financial differences between buying and renting that you should check out. 

:::

In the grand scheme of things, the financial difference between buying and renting is negligible at most. The decision typically ends up being decided by lifestyle factors rather than mathematical ones. 

### The question you should really be asking

But, here's the reason why the question is stupid. What is the difference between a $900 a month rent payment and a $900 a month mortgage payment, *to your Savings Rate?* 

Zero!

:::tip

The question you should really ask is “how do I situate my Housing so it has the minimum possible detrimental effect on my Savings Rate?” 

:::

Once you look at your housing options through the impact they have on your Savings Rate, a clear winner emerges. 

## House Hacking

House hacking (the term) was coined by an [article by Brandon Turner](https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-11-02-hack-housing-get-paid-live-free) of BiggerPockets.com, first introduced to me in [Set for Life](https://www.amazon.com/Set-Life-Dominate-Money-American-ebook/dp/B06Y15M786/ref=sr_1_2?crid=36UFYADVB3E65&dchild=1&keywords=set+for+life+scott+trench&qid=1628033342&sprefix=set+for+life+scott%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-2) by Scott Trench (highly recommended).

The concept is simple. You buy a 1-4 unit property with an FHA loan (3.5% down), and then rent out any spare bedrooms or units so that the cash flow from those units offset your burn for Housing. 

If you do this, in some cases you can *completely eliminate your cash outflow for Housing* (your single largest expense) while enjoying all the other wealth building benefits real estate investing offers.

For House Hacking, any income generation is fair game, be it renting out a room full time, hosting on Airbnb, or even having people park on your lawn for football games.

:::note

The one rule of House Hacking is that the property should cash flow as a rental once you move out.

## Other Strategies

An easier (although less powerful) option is to make your current home more energy efficient. Options include installing more energy efficient appliances (like smart bulbs and thermostats), as well as better insulation for doors and windows. If you plan to live in your current property for a long time, and want to reduce the utility costs of running the house, these are good options.

Building a tiny house is also kind of trendy now, and so is living in an RV and touring the country if you can work remotely. Personally, I would just house hack, but these are equally valid, mortgage free options.

If you will be moving in the near future and need flexibility, you can also temporarily live in Airbnbs instead of signing a full 12-month lease. This is great if you need to figure out any details of your work life while testing the waters living in a new city, and is also a good way to test moving out of your parents’ house for the first time. The prices month to month will likely be similar to renting, so it's worth considering. 

### Airbnb

[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) offers a way to make money renting out the spare room in your house. This can be an exciting way to make money off of the extra space you have, and depending how valauble your space is, can reap similar financial benefits to house hacking.

## The Worst Thing You Can Do

The worst thing you can do is to buy a cripplingly expensive house, maxing out on the "minimum" payment that you could afford.

:::danger 

The down payment for this house likely obliterated your Runway, and your Savings Rate has been seriously crippled by taking on the maximum payment you can. This is probably the single worst financial mistake that anyone can make, but it will get tons of likes by stupid people on Instagram.
