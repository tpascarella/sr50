## Importance

As previously mentioned, Savings Rate is the most important KPI when determining how long it will take to reach financial independence. We recommend reaching a Savings Rate of 50%, but if you can get it higher than that, do so!

However, it would be impossible to advise as to how to increase your Savings Rate, without first going over how your spending likely breaks down. **Here is a breakdown of the average American's spending patterns.**

### - Considerations

- The numbers above are averages taken from government created surveys.
- To figure out your specific numbers, you will need to complete a few [budgets](/lifestyle/budgets.md).
- Housing, Transportation, and Food (The Big 3) take up 62% of the average American spending. 
>Since we want to reach a Savings Rate of 50%, we will need to take drastic action on these 3 categories. 

### - References

- The above data comes from the [Consumer Expenditures Report](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/consumer-expenditures/2020/pdf/home.pdf) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
