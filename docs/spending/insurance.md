# Insurance

Most people are intimidated by insurance and think it's scary. Thankfully, due to the magic of the internet, we have tools to help.

## PolicyGenius

I recommend visiting [PolicyGenius.com](https://www.policygenius.com/). PolicyGenius will take a questionnaire of your lifestyle, show you which types of insurance you need and how much, and then presents you with the best quotes for each type of insurance.

Don't let your financial advisor decide what insurance is necessary, they make commissions on the sale and they will absolutely sell you a bloated and unecessary insurance package.
