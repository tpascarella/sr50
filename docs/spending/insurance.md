# Insurance

Most people are intimidated by insurance and think it's scary. Thankfully, due to the magic of the internet, we have tools to help.

## Shop Around

I recommend visiting [The Zebra](https://www.thezebra.com/). And to get quotes from various insurance companies every 6 months to 1 year. You can find out one day that you are eligible to get insurance for 25% lower costs than you are, and a 1 hour phone call can reap big rewards.

[PolicyGenius.com](https://www.policygenius.com/) has a great catalog of educational content you can look through, but I have had issues with the website in the past and use The Zebra to get my quotes.

## Do This Yourself

Don't let your financial advisor decide what insurance is necessary, they make commissions on the sale and they will absolutely sell you a bloated and unecessary insurance package.
