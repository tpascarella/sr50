# Insurance

## Importance

Insurance takes up about 12% of your take-home pay. We can't completely eliminate insurance costs, but can mitigate their impact.

## Strategies for Paying Less for Insurance

### - Shop around

I recommend visiting [The Zebra](https://www.thezebra.com/) and to get quotes from various insurance companies every 6 months to 1 year. You may find out one day that you are eligible to get insurance for 25% lower costs, and a half hour phone call can reap big rewards.

[PolicyGenius.com](https://www.policygenius.com/) has a great catalog of educational content you can look through, but I have had issues with getting quotes in the past, and for that reason I use The Zebra to get my quotes.

### - Call and ask for lower rates

If you call your insurance company and say another one is willing to insure you for a lower rate, they will probably lower your rate. It's cheaper to keep you at a lower rate than lose you completely to a competitor.

### - Do this yourself

Don't let your financial advisor decide what insurance is necessary, they will absolutely sell you a bloated and unecessary insurance package.
