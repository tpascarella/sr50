# Spending Overview

As you have heard, Savings Rate is the most important KPI when determining how long it will take to reach financial independence. We recommend reaching a Savings Rate of 50%+. If you can get it higher than that, do so!

But it would be impossible to give you advice as to how to increase your Savings Rate without first going over how your spending breaks down. Here is the breakdown of the average American's spending.

## 33% goes to Housing

Housing is the single largest expense category for most Americans, taking up 33% of average spending. In the [Housing](housing.md) section, we will cover ways to reduce your housing costs, if not completely eliminate them with a strategy known as *house hacking*. We will also cover ways to make your home more energy efficient and make money with your space. 

## 17% goes to Transportation

Transportation is the 2nd largest expense category, taking up 17% of average spending. Most of this is from needlessly bloated car payments, but also with bloated commuting expenses.  

## 16% goes to Food

Food is the 3rd largest expense category, taking up 16% of average spending. This is split pretty evenly between buying groceries and eating out, and we will go over expenses to reduce spending on both of these.

## 34% goes to Everything Else

34% of spending goes to other categories, education, clothing, alcohol, social life expenses, etc. Most of these are the expenses people try to cut out in an attempt to save money, but in relation to the Big 3 mentioned earlier, these can be kept, within reason.

## Main Takeaway

Housing, Transportation, and Food take up 62% of the average American spending. 

Since we want to reach a Savings Rate of 50%, we will need to take drastic action on these 3 categories, which we will cover in the next sections.
