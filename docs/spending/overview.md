# Spending Overview

As you have heard, Savings Rate is the most important KPI when determining how long it will take to reach financial independence. We recommend reaching a Savings Rate of 50%+. If you can get it higher than that, do so!

But it would be impossible to give you advice as to how to increase your Savings Rate without first going over how your spending breaks down. Here is the breakdown of the average American's spending.

* 33% goes to [Housing](housing.md)
* 17% goes to [Transportation](transportation.md)
* 16% goes to [Food](food.md)
* 34% goes to [Everything Else](everything-else.md)

## Main Takeaway
