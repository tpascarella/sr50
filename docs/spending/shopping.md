# Shopping

Shopping is not a bad thing, per se. *Compulsive* shopping, however, is. So you need to be intentional with your purchasing decisions, especially when you are just starting out. I want you to think of shopping as a scheduled military resupply.

Take inventory of what you have, what you need, and then add a few things you want and figure out how much everything will cost. And then, after you've done the math, buy everything you need once a month, or once a quarter. Then don't buy anything until the next resupply. 

If you do this, then you don't have to constantly fight with yourself on "should I go shopping?" because you know that your needs will be covered at a regular cadence. Also, as you have more time to think about things, you'll buy better quality items for the few things you do purchase.

## Using Credit Rewards

It's a good idea to use a new credit card for these resupply purchases. You can usually get a 20% rebate on these purchases by using the rewards programs for various cards, which recoups some of the capital you spent on this.
