# Shopping

Shopping is not a bad thing, per se. *Compulsive* shopping, however, is. So you need to be intentional with your purchasing decisions, especially when you are just starting out. I want you to think of shopping as a scheduled military resupply.

Take inventory of what you have, what you actually need, and supplement it with some wants as you figure out how much everything will cost. And then, after you've done the math, buy everything you need once a month, or quarter. Then you don't buy anything until the next resupply. 

If you do this, then you don't have to constantly fight with yourself on "should I go shopping?" because you know that your needs will be covered at a regular cadence. Also, as you have more time to think about things, you'll buy better quality items for the few things you do purchase.

It's also a good idea to use a credit card with rewards to reclaim some of the capital back. For example, you can use some Amex cards for 20% rebates on Amazon purchases, or $100 back on $750 spent using a Citi Bank card.
