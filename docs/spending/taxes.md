# (~33%) - Taxes 

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

>An often neglected third (!) of your salary

## Importance

![Taxes proportion](/img/taxes-proportion.svg)

Taxes go largely unnoticed because they are an invisible expense. You don't *pay* taxes, you have taxes *taken* from you, and then you get back the excess in April. 

However, underestimating taxes is big a mistake since taxes take up approximately 1/3rd of your salary.

### - This should be one of the first things You fix

As a result, taxes should be one of the first places you optimize. No one, and I mean *no one* will be sad about paying less in taxes.

## Tax Reduction Strategies

Taxes are the price you have to pay to live in this country, but you are not required to pay any more than is absolutely necessary.

## Should I Hire a Tax Accountant?

Probably not yet.

If your tax situation is still relatively simple (meaning you just have a W2 and/or a house), then it is perfectly fine to do your taxes yourself using online software.

I personally use [TaxAct](https://www.taxact.com/), but [this article from NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/best-tax-software) will explain which options are good.

:::

### - When it becomes appropriate to hire someone

Once you have multiple business ventures or rental properties to account for, as well as if you are beginning to withdraw retirement accounts, then and only then should you hire a professional to do your taxes for you. By this point they will likely pay for themself.

## Proper Paperwork Storage

### - Physical

Keep the previous 7 years worth of tax forms in a fireproof in a fireproof safe. Do not store these online!

### - Digital

Store your tax documents offline on a hard drive or flash drive. If you want to store it online (it's riskier) then get a service with a *vault* feature for added security. A Google Drive account is not secure enough!
