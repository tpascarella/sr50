# Taxes

## Why You Should Reduce Your Tax Bill First

![Taxes proportion](/img/taxes-dark.svg)

Taxes, as an expense, go largely unnoticed because they are invisible. You don't *pay* taxes, you have taxes *taken* from you, and then you get back the excess in April. But thinking this way is a mistake since taxes make up approximately 1/3rd of your salary.

Taxes should be one of the first places you optimize because no one, and I mean *no one* will be sad about paying less in taxes.

## Tax Reduction Strategies

Here are some strategies you can use to reduce your tax liability:
- Fix your W-4 form so that only the bare minimum is kept from you. This will maximize your paycheck.
- Invest in Real Estate. 
- Have kids! (If you're ready)
- Move to a state with no income tax.

## Should I Hire a CPA?

Probably not yet.

If your tax situation is relatively simple (meaning you only have a W2), then it is perfectly ok to do your taxes yourself using online software. 

However, once you have multiple business ventures, rental properties, as well as if you are beginning to withdraw retirement accounts, then you should probably hire an professional to do your taxes for you. By this point, they will pay for themselves.
