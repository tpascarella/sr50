# Transportation

## Car Payments

Don't have a car payment. That's the best strategy. 

The second best strategy is to keep your payment down to the minimum you can reasonably manage. Car payments are always a bad idea. Cars only go down in value, so they aren't an investment. You don’t need a Mercedes to transport you to your job, your car is just a tool to get you from one point to another without leaving you stranded. It’s only a status symbol in your brain. 

## Commuting

Behind car payments, the second biggest problem with transportation is that people seriously underestimate how expensive their commutes are, in both money and time. People trap themselves into a lifestyle where their house is over an hour away from their jobs, and as a result they “need” that fancy car for the drive.

Two questions:
 Why can’t you find a job closer to where you live? 
 If not, why can’t you live closer to your job? 
I’m sure you can come up with 100 reasons why these questions don’t apply to you. 2% of them might be right, 98% are probably wrong. These are real dollars we’re talking about that are unnecessarily leaking from your budget because you strapped yourself with an inefficient lifestyle.

If you have no choice but to have a long commute, at the very least don’t waste that time listening to garbage radio. Find a few educational podcasts you enjoy listening to, book summaries are also a great use of time (I like Productivity Game on Youtube). The goal is to continually learn new things while driving, making driving a much more productive activity. I usually listen to Starting Strength Radio, the Y Combinator podcast, Hoover Institution episodes as well as various Jordan Peterson clips online.

## Biking

Or, if you're really smart, you can transport yourself for free by biking. A good bike has become the new status symbol for Financial Independence. You can DIY mountain bikes with a motor and a Tesla battery, and these things can go over 40 miles an hour, they’re awesome! Just don’t tell my Madre, she worries.

## Side Hustles

With the car you currently do have, and if you aren't willing to downgrade, at least use it to make some extra money. There are lots of ways you can make a decent amount of cash with your car, including:
Uber
Lyft
Instacart
Doordash
Postmates
Turo
Give one of them a try until you make at least $500. After that, if you want to continue, great! If not, move on to another.

Business travel expenses can be deducted on your taxes, but commuting expenses cannot. The difference is that commuting expenses take place before you start working, while business expenses occur during working hours. For calculating business miles, download MileIQ on your phone and classify your business trips, and the app will give you the form to deduct them on your taxes.
