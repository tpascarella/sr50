# 16% - Transportation

import Slogan from '/src/components/Slogan';

>Don't have a car payment & live close to your work.

## Importance

Transportation is the second largest expense category for most Americans. Most of this is comes from having too expensive a car, and too long a commute.

## Car Payments

:::tip Never have a car payment

That's the best strategy. 

:::

But this is probably not feasible for most people. The second best strategy is to keep your car payment down to the minimum you can reasonably manage. I'm not going to give a recommendation like "only spend 15% of your take home pay on your car payment" because your first inclination should be to have it be as little as possible.

Car payments are always a bad idea. Cars only go down in value, so they aren't an investment. Your car is just a tool to get you from one point to another without leaving you stranded. 

>It’s only a status symbol in your brain. 

## Buying a Car vs. Leasing a Car

I recommend leasing over buying because it lets you drive a better car at the same monthly payment. You have less freedom with leased cars, but you also have lower maintenance costs since the dealerships want to keep the cars in as good a condition as possible.

Building equity in cars is useless because cars always go down in value. Leasing is less of a headache and gives you far more flexibility in terms of upgrading or replacement.

## Commuting

The second biggest problem with transportation is that people seriously underestimate how expensive their commutes are, in both money and time. People trap themselves into a lifestyle where their house is over an hour away from their jobs, and as a result they “need” a fancy car for the commute.

Two questions:
- Why can’t you find a job closer to where you live? 
- If not, why can’t you live closer to your job? 

I’m sure you can come up with 100 reasons why these questions don’t apply to you. 2% of them might be right, 98% are probably wrong. 

### - Make productive use of your commuting time

If you have no choice but to have a long commute, at the very least don’t waste that time listening to garbage radio. Find a few educational podcasts you enjoy, book summaries are also a great use of time. 

The goal is to continually learn new things while you're driving, making it a much more productive activity. I recommend the [Starting Strength](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/starting-strength-radio/id687932160), [BiggerPockets](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/biggerpockets-real-estate-podcast/id594419649) & [BiggerPockets Money](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/biggerpockets-money-podcast/id1330225136), [Y Combinator](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/y-combinator/id1236907421), [Uncommon Knowledge](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/uncommon-knowledge/id1378389941) , and the [Jordan Peterson](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-jordan-b-peterson-podcast/id1184022695) podcasts.

## Biking

Biking is free, and nobody talks about this!

An ebike has become the new status symbol for the FIRE movement, replacing the BMW. You can DIY mountain bikes with a motor and a Tesla battery, and these things can go over 40 miles an hour, they’re awesome! Just don’t tell my Madre, she worries.

[Here is a good article explaining how to DIY an electric mountain bike.](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/05/25/recipe-for-a-badass-diy-electric-mountain-bike/)

## Side Hustles

Using the car you currently do have, if you aren't willing to downgrade, at least try to make some extra money with it. There are lots of ways you can make a decent amount of cash with your car, including:
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/us/en/s/d/join/?next_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrivers.uber.com%2Fp3%2F&source=auth)
- [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/driver)
- [Instacart](https://shoppers.instacart.com/role/full-service)
- [Doordash](https://www.doordash.com/dasher/signup/)
- [Turo](https://turo.com/us/en/list-your-car)

Give one a try until you make at least $500.

### - Tax considerations

Business travel expenses can be deducted on your taxes, however commuting expenses cannot. The difference is that commuting expenses take place *before you start working*, while business expenses occur *during work hours.* 

If you have business miles and need to deduct them, download [MileIQ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mileiq-mileage-tracker-log/id578830929) and classify your business trips, and the app will give you the form to deduct them on your taxes.

## Self Driving

Tesla and Comma AI are the two companies that have made serious progress in self driving cars. 

### - Tesla

Tesla cars are known for their ridiculous 0-60 acceleration, and for how safe they are. However their high price tag makes then unavailable to the masses, at least yet. You should only buy a Tesla once you have reached [Stage 6.](/fi-stages/stage-6.md)

### - Comma AI

If Tesla is the iOS of self driving cars, Comma AI is the android. They sell devices that can hook up into common cars (Toyotas, Hondas, Hyundais, etc.) and gives them self driving capabilities with their open source software, Openpilot.

Make sure the next car your purchase is [compatible with Comma devices](https://comma.ai/vehicles), and then buy a [Comma Three.](https://comma.ai/shop/products/three)
